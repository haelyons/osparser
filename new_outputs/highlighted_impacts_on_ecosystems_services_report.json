Therefore, considering that the EEA classification referred to in this paper is also  based on CICES, this demonstrates the suitability of the classifications used and the approach  applied in this paper to identify the appropriate list of ecosystem services in view of both natural  capital accounting and also the qualitative assessment of impacts on marine ecosystem services in  the North-East Atlantic Ocean envisaged in this report. 33    RWS INFORMATION | Impacts on ecosystem services due to changes in the state of the environment in the North- East Atlantic Ocean | 11 March 2022  2.2. Interlinkages with the Natural Capital Account  This section aims to highlight the interconnections between the approach and objectives of this  report with the Natural Capital Account and its components. As reported in Chapter 1, the ecosystem approach applied by OSPAR explicitly links the state of  the marine ecosystems and their components with the ecosystem services they provide and that  support human welfare.",
