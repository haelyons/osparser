Abundance indicators can also be constructed from time series data collected at sea / in the offshore  environment; a pilot assessment of such a candidate indicator (for the Southern North Sea) is also provided  in the QSR 2023: see B1 Marine bird Abundance – non-breeding birds offshore Pilot Assessment  Assessment Method  Overview  This indicator assessment begins by constructing a time series of annual estimates of ‘relative breeding  abundance’ or ‘relative non-breeding abundance’ of each species in each OSPAR Region or sub-division  thereof (see section on Spatial Aggregation and Figure a). For the majority of species, data are available for  either breeding abundance or non-breeding abundance; both are available for only five species in the Arctic  Waters (Region I), 14 species in the Greater North Sea (Region II) and just one species in the Celtic Seas  (Region III). Relative abundance is the number of adult birds or breeding pairs estimated each year as a  proportion of a baseline (see section below on parameter / metric). Each species-specific estimate of annual  relative abundance is compared against a threshold value.",

It is acknowledged that the year on which the baseline is set will be highly influential in determining  the outcome of the indicator, especially in situations where population declines are predominant. The time  period considered in the assessment was shifted forward from 1980 to 2020 to 1991 to 2020 because of data  scarcity prior 1991. This could potentially risk an ‘optimistic’ bias in the indicator’s outputs, with more species  reaching the threshold value relative to the baseline 1991 to 2000 than they would, relative to 1980 to 1989.",
