Thematic assessment,Fish,OK,p00956_qsr2023_fish_ta.pdf,"Climate change represents a major pressure on marine fish ecosystems in the OSPAR Maritime Area, with ocean warming being the most extensively studied impact. Rising sea temperatures driven by greenhouse gas emissions alter fish growth, reproduction, behavior, migration patterns, spatial abundance and distribution, potentially causing community-level changes.

General trends of ocean warming impacts include distributional shifts toward northern ranges of fish distributions, with larger species decreasing in body size while smaller fish adapt more readily to changing environments. Earlier spawning patterns are occurring, and fish biomass changes are reflected through geographic changes in catch. The average body size of marine organisms is projected to shrink under ocean warming both as direct impact and adaptive response, with small-bodied pelagic fish being possibly more resilient.

Global models project continued warming in the North Atlantic, with greatest warming predicted for the Atlantic-Arctic including Barents Sea and Greenland Seas, alongside changes to primary production and an overall decline in primary productivity for much of the North-East Atlantic. Climate change has already effectively reduced maximum sustainable yield for many important stocks globally.

Beyond temperature effects, the broader suite of climate-associated changes includes ocean acidification, sea ice changes, alterations in salinity and oxygen levels, coastal erosion, and extreme events. These impacts may be cumulative when environmental changes interact with biological factors like density dependence and food web interactions. With environmental conditions expected to change drastically in the next two decades, traditional fishing reference points assuming constant climate conditions may become obsolete, requiring adaptive management approaches for ecosystem resilience.",5,"Climate change represents a significant and multifaceted threat to marine fish in the OSPAR Maritime Area. Ocean warming driven by greenhouse gas emissions alters growth, reproduction, behavior, migration patterns, spatial abundance and distribution, potentially causing community-level changes. Rising sea temperatures in the North Atlantic are expected to continue, with greatest warming predicted for the Atlantic-Arctic including the Barents Sea and Greenland Seas.

Climate change has already effectively reduced Maximum Sustainable Yield for many important fish stocks globally, challenging traditional stock assessment approaches that assume constant abiotic conditions. Fish biomass in the Arctic is expected to change due to fast warming and freshening, potentially reducing reproductive capacity and making stocks vulnerable to previously sustainable fishing levels. The average body size of marine organisms is projected to shrink under ocean warming, with small-bodied pelagic fish possibly more resilient to climate change.

Temperature-related distributional shifts toward northern ranges are documented for all examined commercial fish species in Europe. Atlantic cod stocks show altered spawning phenology due to rising sea temperatures, with negative effects predicted for populations at warmer distribution edges and positive effects in lower thermal ranges. Climate change impacts extend beyond temperature to include ocean acidification, sea ice changes, altered salinity and oxygen levels, and extreme events affecting early life stages.

Additional pressures include changes in primary production timing leading to mismatches between fish larvae and prey, altered food web interactions, and cumulative impacts when environmental changes interact with biological factors. Climate change ranks among the highest pressures affecting fish, alongside fishing mortality, with impacts expected to expand as research continues.",5,"Climate change impacts species, habitats and ecosystems through multiple interconnected pathways. Rising ocean temperatures driven by greenhouse gas emissions alter growth, reproduction, behavior, migration patterns, spatial abundance and distribution, with potential to cause community-level changes.

Key impacts include distributional shifts toward northern ranges, with all examined European commercial fish stocks showing distributional changes driven primarily by temperature. Species identified as ""big movers"" include anchovy expanding into the North Sea, white anglerfish increasing in Iceland and northern North Sea, and cod expanding northward in the Barents Sea. The average body size of marine organisms is projected to shrink under ocean warming both as direct impact and adaptive response, with larger species decreasing in body size while smaller fish more readily adapt. Climate change triggers earlier spawning, with rising sea temperatures causing shifts in spawning phenology in temperature-dependent species like Atlantic cod.

Fish biomass changes significantly, with Arctic fish biomass expected to alter due to fast warming and freshening. These conditions may reduce reproductive capacity, making stocks vulnerable to previously sustainable fishing levels. Cold-water species like arctic and boreal fish face particular impacts. Behavioral changes include displacement and altered swimming and migration patterns, affecting fitness, survival and reproductive success.

Climate change pressures encompass temperature regime changes, stratification and circulation pattern alterations, acidification, nutrient enrichment, and water chemistry modifications. Beyond temperature effects, broader climate-associated changes include sea ice variations, salinity and oxygen changes, coastal erosion, and extreme events. Impacts prove cumulative when environmental changes interact with biological factors like density dependence and food web interactions, with altered primary production timing creating mismatches between fish larvae and prey.",5,"The OSPAR reports identify several critical gaps relating to climate change impacts on marine fish and ecosystems:

**Research and Knowledge Gaps**

Most research on climate change impacts on fish has focused solely on ocean warming, while the impacts of other environmental changes associated with greenhouse gas emissions (ocean acidification, sea ice changes) remain largely unexplored and will only be revealed through further research. Climate change impacts act in tandem with other factors like density dependence and trophic interactions, making them difficult to disentangle from these complex interactions.

**Assessment and Management Gaps**

Traditional stock assessment approaches assume constant abiotic conditions, but climate change has already effectively reduced Maximum Sustainable Yield for many important stocks globally. With environmental conditions expected to change drastically in the next two decades, estimates of fishing reference points under average, constant climate conditions are becoming obsolete, requiring novel approaches to incorporate ecosystem-driven changes into current fisheries advice frameworks.

**Data and Monitoring Gaps**

Regional evidence for trends in climate change and ocean acidification was not available in sufficient detail for comprehensive assessment. There are large gaps in spatial data, especially beyond the coastal zone, limiting the ability to determine whether mitigation measures are effective.

**Geographic Coverage Gaps**

Gaps exist in geographic coverage of marine protected areas, particularly in the Arctic region, along with gaps in ecological coherence and understanding of management effectiveness for climate resilience.

**Predictive Model Limitations**

Predictions of species range shifts potentially overestimate movements because they often ignore food web interactions and allometry, while models show slower range shifts when dynamic trophic interactions are considered versus single-species approaches.",5,"OSPAR recommends developing a practical approach for regional-scale ecosystem-based management through the 'Collective Arrangement' and cooperation with fisheries management bodies to strengthen ecosystem resilience to climate change. By 2024, they will initiate discussions on this approach to safeguard marine biodiversity and ecosystem services.

The reports identify several areas requiring further investigation. Most research on climate change impacts has focused on ocean warming, while impacts of other greenhouse gas-related changes like ocean acidification and sea ice changes require additional study. The impacts of ocean acidification on fish, particularly early life stages, are less frequently studied but may be significant.

Current climate change impacts documented include species distribution shifts toward northern ranges, body size changes (larger species decreasing while smaller fish adapt more readily), earlier spawning, altered fish biomass, changes in recruitment and productivity, and range shifts with management implications. Environmental conditions are expected to change drastically in the next two decades, potentially making fishing reference points under constant climate conditions obsolete.

Critical research gaps include the need for more spatial data, especially beyond coastal zones, and better understanding of cumulative effects from human activities on ecosystem state and ecosystem services. The suite of climate-associated changes is broader than currently studied, including changes in sea ice, salinity, oxygen, coastal erosion, and extreme events, with the potential for expanded impact lists as research progresses.

Fish populations will experience both direct climate impacts and indirect effects through changes to fisheries management. Future greenhouse gas emission reduction efforts might cause fishery displacement due to gear or technology changes. Better understanding of complexity in cumulative effects is critical for appropriately targeting ecosystem-based management measures.",5,"Ocean acidification represents a significant but understudied environmental pressure in the OSPAR Maritime Area. Most climate change research on fish has focused on ocean warming, while the impacts of other greenhouse gas-related environmental changes including ocean acidification will be revealed as further research develops.

Ocean acidification has been identified as an important pressure for fish in the North-East Atlantic, with high exposure scores demonstrating its ubiquitous nature across the region. However, regional evidence for trends in ocean acidification intensity was not available in sufficient detail to be utilized in the current assessment.

The impacts of ocean acidification on fish are less frequently studied but may affect early life stages. Changes in pH represent one of several environmental impacts that can interact cumulatively with other factors including temperature, salinity, and oxygen changes, as well as biological interactions such as density dependence and food web dynamics.

Ocean acidification is categorized alongside climate change pressures that include changes in temperature regimes, stratification and circulation patterns, nutrient enrichment, and changes in water chemistry. These pressures collectively contribute to multiple impacts on fish populations and associated ecosystem services through complex pathways of cumulative causes and consequences.

The assessment acknowledges that the suite of climate-associated changes affecting fish extends beyond the most frequently studied impacts, with ocean acidification being part of broader environmental changes that also include sea ice alterations, salinity shifts, oxygen depletion, coastal erosion, and extreme events. The potential for expanding impacts on fish populations from ocean acidification remains largely unexplored and requires further research to fully understand its effects.",4,"Ocean acidification impacts on species, habitats and ecosystems remain largely understudied compared to ocean warming effects. The impacts of ocean acidification on fish are less often studied but may affect early life stages. Most research on climate change impacts on fish has focused on ocean warming, while the impacts of other environmental changes associated with greenhouse gas emissions, including ocean acidification, will be revealed as further research is conducted.

Ocean acidification is identified as one of the climate change-related pressures alongside changes in temperature regimes, stratification and circulation patterns, nutrient enrichment, and changes in water chemistry. These environmental impacts can interact cumulatively with other biological changes such as density dependence and food web interactions, creating complex impact pathways.

The broader context shows that pH changes, along with temperature, salinity, and oxygen variations, can lead to altered timing of primary production, which may create mismatches between first-feeding fish larvae and their prey when combined with ocean warming effects on fish phenology. Climate-associated changes projected by global models include rising sea temperatures and changes to primary production, with acidification representing part of this broader suite of environmental alterations.

Regional evidence for trends in ocean acidification was not available in sufficient detail to be utilized in the current assessment, highlighting a significant knowledge gap. The climate-associated changes are described as broader than those most frequently studied, including changes in sea ice, salinity, oxygen, coastal erosion, and extreme events, with acidification among these less-researched impacts.

While specific mechanisms and quantified impacts of ocean acidification on marine species, habitats and ecosystems are not detailed in the available context, it is recognized as an important pressure requiring further research to understand its full implications for marine biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.",2,65,8,96
All other assessments,Agriculture,ok,Agriculture.pdf,"The provided context contains only a brief mention of climate change, which appears in the discussion of European agricultural policy reforms rather than as a substantive scientific analysis. Climate change action is listed as one of nine objectives in the Commission's proposals for Common Agricultural Policy reform, alongside mandatory measures to preserve carbon-rich soils and ensure crop rotation to reduce nitrous oxide levels.

The context also notes that plastic mulch films used in agriculture are designed to ""protect against harsh climate conditions,"" but this represents an adaptation measure rather than analysis of climate change itself.

The remainder of the extensive context focuses primarily on agricultural impacts related to eutrophication, nutrient pollution (nitrogen and phosphorus), ammonia emissions, and plastic contamination in marine environments. While these agricultural pressures may intersect with climate change impacts, the provided text does not examine climate change as a distinct environmental pressure or analyze its effects on marine ecosystems within the OSPAR Maritime Area.

The context demonstrates that eutrophication remains a significant issue despite nutrient input reductions since 1990, with continued problems in the Greater North Sea, Celtic Seas, and Bay of Biscay. Agricultural sources account for approximately 90% of ammonia emissions in the European Union, contributing to both air pollution and marine eutrophication when deposited in water bodies.

However, to comprehensively address what these reports say specifically about climate change would require additional context that examines climate-related pressures, impacts, and responses in detail.",2,"Based on the provided context, climate change is mentioned only briefly and primarily in relation to agricultural policy rather than as a detailed threat assessment. The reformed Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) proposals include ""climate change action"" as one of nine stated objectives, alongside environmental care and biodiversity preservation. Mandatory measures are proposed to reduce ammonia and nitrous oxide levels and preserve carbon-rich soils through nutrient management tools and crop rotation requirements.

However, the context provided focuses predominantly on agricultural pressures rather than climate change threats. The main documented pressures relate to eutrophication from agricultural nutrient runoff, which continues to affect sensitive areas like estuaries, fjords, and river plumes in the OSPAR Maritime Area. Despite nitrogen inputs being reduced by approximately one quarter and phosphorus by half in the Greater North Sea since 1990, eutrophication pressure remains high, particularly on the south-eastern coast of the Greater North Sea and localized areas of the Celtic Seas.

Additional agricultural pressures include atmospheric ammonia emissions (with agriculture responsible for around 90% of EU ammonia emissions), pesticide runoff affecting freshwater and estuarine crustacea with potential ecosystem cascade effects, microplastics from agricultural sources entering marine environments, and sediment runoff degrading spawning habitats for species like sea lamprey.

The context does not provide substantive information about specific climate change threats, impacts, or pressures on marine ecosystems. The available material is insufficient to comprehensively address climate change-related threats, as it primarily examines agricultural impacts on water quality and marine environments rather than climate-driven changes to marine systems.",2,"The provided context does not address climate change impacts on species, habitats and ecosystems. Instead, the context exclusively focuses on agricultural impacts on marine environments, particularly through eutrophication, nutrient pollution, and pesticide runoff.

The context demonstrates that agricultural activities significantly impact marine biodiversity and ecosystems through several mechanisms. Eutrophication results from excessive water enrichment with nutrients, causing accelerated algae and plant growth that creates undesirable disturbances to organism balance and declines in water quality. Despite nutrient input reductions of approximately 25% for nitrogen and 50% for phosphorus in the Greater North Sea since 1990, eutrophication pressure remained high on the south-eastern coast of the Greater North Sea and localized Celtic Sea areas during 2006-2014.

Agricultural sources contribute 90% of European Union ammonia emissions, which cause eutrophication when deposited in water and soils. Nitrogen discharges from agriculture remain problematic despite phosphorus discharge reductions exceeding 50% compared to 1985 levels. Pesticides from agricultural runoff affect freshwater and estuarine crustacea, with effects cascading through aquatic ecosystems, though marine ecosystem impacts remain poorly documented.

Additional agricultural impacts include sediment runoff degrading river spawning habitats for fish like sea lamprey, and potential microplastic contamination from agricultural plastic films entering surface waters and affecting riverine and marine life. European waters face significant pressure from diffuse agricultural pollution, with only 38% of surface waters achieving good chemical status and 40% achieving good ecological status.

The context contains no information about climate change effects on species, habitats, or ecosystems, focusing entirely on agricultural pollution impacts.",1,"Based on the provided context, there are no explicitly identified gaps specifically related to climate change in these OSPAR reports. The context primarily focuses on agricultural impacts regarding eutrophication, nutrient pollution, and pesticides rather than climate change issues.

The context mentions climate change only briefly in two instances: the reformed Common Agricultural Policy includes ""climate change action"" among nine proposed objectives, and agricultural plastic use is mentioned to ""protect against harsh climate conditions."" However, no specific gaps related to climate change are identified or discussed.

The gaps that are explicitly mentioned in the reports relate to other environmental issues:

Challenges remain in properly accounting for all nutrient inputs from different sources and preventing nutrient losses to water and air through effective manure management. Water monitoring requires strengthening, especially of saline surface waters, to improve data comparability on nitrogen pollution and provide a more detailed picture of overall water quality in the EU.

Concerns about atmospheric and riverine nutrient inputs identified in QSR 2010 still remained as of the reporting period. Progress on implementing measures to assist agriculture and forestry in reducing destruction or degradation of spawning habitats and river migration routes is unclear.

The reports identify needs for refining assessment methodologies, including modelling of nutrient transports, and improving monitoring frameworks through coordinated use of novel observation tools and coordination of data collection on sources, inputs and environmental status.

While agricultural reforms may reduce environmental impacts, the scale of change depends on details that had yet to be decided at the time of reporting.",1,"Based on the provided context, the recommendations related to climate change are limited, as the text primarily focuses on eutrophication and agricultural impacts rather than comprehensive climate change measures.

**Direct Climate Change Recommendations:**
The revised Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) includes climate change action as one of nine stated objectives, with mandatory measures requiring nutrient management tools to preserve carbon-rich soils and ensure crop rotation. These reforms are expected to reduce environmental impacts from agriculture, though the actual scale depends on implementation details yet to be decided.

**Eutrophication-Related Recommendations:**
OSPAR Contracting Parties are encouraged to implement measures reducing nutrient inputs to problem areas, set appropriate reduction targets for individual areas, and promote consideration of marine eutrophication when revising international nitrogen air emission targets through EU, UNECE, and International Maritime Organization standards.

**Research and Investigation Needs:**
Several areas require further investigation: refining assessment methodologies including nutrient transport modeling, improving monitoring frameworks through coordinated novel observation tools, and enhancing data collection on sources, inputs, and environmental status. Strengthened water monitoring, especially of saline surface waters, would improve nitrogen pollution data comparability and provide more detailed water quality assessments. Challenges remain in accounting for all nutrient inputs from different sources and preventing nutrient losses through effective manure management.

**Implementation Gaps:**
Progress on implementing measures to reduce agricultural impacts on fish spawning habitats remains unclear. Despite reduced nutrient inputs since 1990, eutrophication persists in sensitive areas like estuaries, fjords, and bights, particularly along the southeastern Greater North Sea coast, indicating continued need for enhanced monitoring and assessment approaches.",3,"The provided context does not address ocean acidification. The document focuses exclusively on agricultural impacts related to eutrophication, nutrient pollution, and other agricultural pressures on marine environments.

The context extensively covers eutrophication in the OSPAR Maritime Area, showing that from 2006 to 2014, eutrophication still occurred particularly in nutrient-sensitive areas like estuaries, fjords, and bights. High eutrophication pressure persisted on the south-eastern coast of the Greater North Sea and some Celtic Seas areas, despite nitrogen inputs being reduced by around one quarter and phosphorus by half in the Greater North Sea since 1990.

The document discusses ""acidification"" only in the terrestrial context, specifically referring to the EU National Emissions Ceiling Directive 2010, which targets four pollutants responsible for acidification, eutrophication, and ground-level ozone pollution: sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds, and ammonia. This relates to atmospheric acidification from air pollutants, not ocean acidification from CO2 absorption.

Ocean acidification, which occurs when seawater absorbs atmospheric carbon dioxide leading to decreased pH levels, is not mentioned or analyzed anywhere in the provided context. The document's scope is limited to agricultural nutrient inputs, eutrophication processes, pesticide contamination, and microplastic pollution from agricultural sources affecting marine environments, without any discussion of CO2-related pH changes in seawater or their impacts on marine ecosystems.",1,"The provided context does not contain information about ocean acidification impacts on species, habitats and ecosystems. Instead, the context exclusively discusses agricultural impacts on marine environments, focusing primarily on eutrophication, nutrient pollution, and pesticide contamination.

The context documents extensive effects of eutrophication on marine ecosystems. Excessive enrichment of water with nutrients causes accelerated growth of algae (phytoplankton) and plants, resulting in undesirable disturbance to the balance of organisms present and ultimately declining overall water quality. Between 2006-2014, eutrophication persisted in the OSPAR Maritime Area, particularly in nutrient-sensitive areas such as estuaries, fjords, and bights, with high pressure on the south-eastern coast of the Greater North Sea and localized Celtic Sea areas. This occurred despite reduced nitrogen inputs by one quarter and phosphorus by half in the Greater North Sea since 1990.

Nutrient overuse from agriculture has considerable negative impacts on biodiversity and ecosystems. Pesticide run-off affects aquatic systems, with studies indicating likely effects on freshwater and estuarine crustacea, while other research suggests effects cascade through aquatic ecosystems, though specific impacts on marine ecosystems remain poorly documented. Agricultural sediment run-off leads to degradation of river spawning fish habitats. Additionally, microplastics from agricultural sources, including controlled release fertilizers and sewage sludge applications, potentially impact riverine and marine life, though data on this source's importance remains limited.

European waters remain under significant pressure from both diffuse agricultural sources and point-source pollution, with only 40% of surface waters achieving good ecological status, demonstrating widespread ecosystem impacts from agricultural activities rather than ocean acidification.",1,1,0,1
All other assessments,Allis shad,No medata/ pdf,Allis shad.pdf,"Climate change represents a growing concern as a new threat to Allis shad populations in the OSPAR Maritime Area. Predictive modeling under a high emissions climate scenario (assuming constant economic development and population growth with temperature rises of 1-7°C) projects significant distributional shifts by 2100. Under this pessimistic scenario, suitable conditions for Allis shad will decrease in southern European and African habitats including Morocco, Portugal and Spain, while the northern part of their distribution could expand into areas like Scotland and Iceland.

Current evidence suggests climate effects are already observable. A negative correlation exists between age and size at maturity with latitude, indicating a relationship with sea temperature, though this data requires cautious interpretation due to sampling method variations and strong interannual variability.

The primary documented threats remain dam construction and fishing pressures, which have caused population declines exceeding 95% over the last 30 years in some areas. In France, the species has been lost from over 69% of its historical geographical range. Critical population decreases are occurring in Portugal due to 50 years of dam building, particularly in the Minho River basin.

While climate change is explicitly identified as an emerging threat alongside invasive species and predation, the available assessment data focuses predominantly on more immediate anthropogenic pressures like migration barriers and overfishing. The climate projections indicate future range contractions in southern regions where current populations are already critically threatened, potentially compounding existing conservation challenges.",4,"Regarding climate change threats to Allis shad, a predictive model using a high emissions climate change scenario (constant economic development and population growth, temperature rise between 1-7°C) projects significant distributional shifts by 2100. The modeling indicates decreased suitable conditions in southern European and African habitats including Morocco, Portugal, and Spain, while northern distribution areas could expand into Scotland and Iceland.

Climate change is identified as a growing concern among new threats affecting Allis shad populations during the current assessment period (2009-2021). However, the species faces multiple interconnected pressures that may compound climate impacts. Migration obstacles from dams represent the main historical and current threat, with Portugal's Minho river basin experiencing particular impact over the last 50 years. The species has been lost in over 69% of its historical geographical range in France, with Loire and Garonne catchments showing over 95% decline in the last 30 years.

Additional emerging pressures include anthropogenic aquatic noise affecting individual development, physiology, and behavior, plus electromagnetic fields and underwater noise from marine renewable energy developments that may disrupt migration behavior in diadromous fish. These species use Earth's magnetic fields for orientation during migrations. The European catfish range extension poses a significant mortality threat in freshwater habitats.

The species shows particular vulnerability to physiological stresses during migration between fresh and saline water. Estuarine fishing mortality combines with habitat degradation from gravel extraction damaging spawning grounds. Knowledge gaps on ecology and distribution data complicate efforts to define target conditions for species protection and restoration.",4,"Climate change is projected to cause significant distributional shifts for Allis shad by 2100, with decreased suitable conditions in southern European and African habitats including Morocco, Portugal and Spain, while northern distributions may expand into areas like Scotland and Iceland. These projections are based on a high emissions scenario involving constant economic development, population growth, and temperature rises between 1 and 7°C.

The species faces multiple climate-related stresses compounding existing threats. Allis shad populations have already declined dramatically, with over 95% decline in some French river systems over the past 30 years and losses from 69% of their historical geographical range in France. The Loire and Garonne catchments show significant population declines over three decades.

Current habitat degradation affects both spawning grounds and juvenile habitats, with gravel extraction particularly damaging these critical areas. The species is physiologically vulnerable during migration between fresh and saline water, making them susceptible to changing environmental conditions. Population declines have been attributed to multiple factors including habitat alteration, migration barriers from dam construction, and overfishing, with climate change representing an emerging additional threat.

The extension of invasive species ranges, such as European catfish, poses significant mortality threats in Allis shad freshwater habitats. Marine renewable energy development creates electromagnetic fields and underwater noise that may affect migration behavior, as diadromous species use Earth's magnetic field for navigation. Anthropogenic aquatic noise shows emerging evidence of affecting individual development, physiology, and behavior, though knowledge remains limited about these newly recognized climate-related impacts.",4,"The OSPAR report identifies several critical knowledge gaps specifically related to climate change impacts on Allis shad populations. There is considerable lack of knowledge on the adult marine life stage of both Alosa species, which particularly impairs expert capability to understand modification in geographical range and disentangle sources of mortality under changing climate conditions.

While predictive modeling under a high emissions climate change scenario (1-7°C temperature rise) projects decreased suitable conditions in southern European and African habitats by 2100, with potential northward expansion into Scotland and Iceland, the report emphasizes caution regarding temperature-related findings. Although negative correlations between age/size at maturity and latitude suggest relations with sea temperature, these results exhibit strong variability between sampling years and employed different methodologies.

Growing concerns exist about newly emerging climate-related threats affecting Allis shad populations. New experimental evidence suggests anthropogenic aquatic noise could affect individual development, physiology, and behavior, while marine renewable energy developments creating electromagnetic fields and underwater noise may impact diadromous fish migration behavior. Recent findings indicate these species use Earth's magnetic field for orientation during migrations, but knowledge remains very scarce.

The report notes low to medium confidence for threat assessments because quantitative data is lacking and impacts of new climate-related threats remain unknown. Data exhibits strong variability between years, making it difficult to establish clear climate-temperature relationships. Insufficient data exists to examine stock condition across the OSPAR Maritime Area comprehensively. This knowledge deficit makes it difficult to define target conditions for species restoration or protection under changing climate conditions.",4,"Based on the provided OSPAR report context, climate change is identified as a growing concern for Allis shad populations. A predictive model using a high emissions climate change scenario (involving constant economic development, population growth, and temperature rises between 1-7°C) projects significant distributional shifts by 2100. Under this scenario, suitable conditions for Allis shad will decrease in southern European and African habitats including Morocco, Portugal and Spain, while the northern part of their distribution could expand into areas like Scotland and Iceland.

Current research shows a negative correlation between both age and size at maturity with latitude, suggesting a relationship with sea temperature, though results exhibit strong variability between sampling years and require cautious interpretation due to different sampling methods.

Several critical knowledge gaps requiring further investigation are identified. Lack of knowledge on Allis shad ecology and distribution data makes it difficult to define target conditions for species restoration or protection. Expert capability to understand geographical range modifications and disentangle sources of mortality is particularly impaired by insufficient data distinguishing between Allis and Twaite shad species.

Emerging threats from marine renewable energy development require urgent research attention. Tidal stream turbines and offshore wind farms create electromagnetic fields and underwater noise that may affect diadromous fish behavior. Knowledge remains very scarce, though recent findings indicate diadromous species use Earth's magnetic fields for orientation and direction-finding during migrations. New experimental evidence suggests anthropogenic aquatic noise could affect individual development, physiology, and behavior, representing newly emerging threats requiring comprehensive investigation to understand their full impact on Allis shad populations.",4,"The provided context does not contain any specific information about ocean acidification. The document focuses exclusively on the assessment of Allis shad populations in the OSPAR Maritime Area, covering their distribution, population status, threats, and conservation measures.

The context discusses various environmental pressures affecting Allis shad, including climate change impacts. A predictive model based on high emissions climate change scenarios projects temperature rises between 1-7°C by 2100, with decreased suitable conditions for Allis shad in southern European and African habitats while northern distribution areas may expand. The analysis notes correlations between sea temperature and species maturity characteristics, with age and size at maturity negatively correlated with latitude.

However, ocean acidification is not mentioned as a threat, impact factor, or consideration in this species assessment. The document identifies primary threats as migration obstacles (dams), overfishing, by-catch, invasive species, anthropogenic noise, electromagnetic fields from marine renewable energy development, and general climate change effects on temperature and habitat suitability.

The context acknowledges growing concerns about newly emerging threats affecting Allis shad populations and notes that knowledge gaps exist regarding various environmental impacts, but ocean acidification is not specifically addressed among these concerns or knowledge gaps. Without relevant information about ocean acidification in the provided context, no substantive analysis of this topic can be derived from this OSPAR report.",1,"The provided context does not address ocean acidification impacts on species, habitats and ecosystems. The text exclusively focuses on Allis shad (Alosa alosa), a migratory fish species, and its status assessment in the OSPAR Maritime Area.

The context contains detailed information about Allis shad population declines, distribution changes, and various threats, but ocean acidification is not mentioned anywhere in the provided passages. Instead, the documented threats to this species include physical barriers like dams obstructing migration routes, overfishing, habitat degradation from gravel extraction, invasive species like Asian clams (Corbicula fluminea), anthropogenic aquatic noise, and climate change effects on suitable habitat conditions.

Climate change impacts are mentioned, with projections showing that by 2100, suitable conditions for Allis shad would decrease in southern European and African habitats (Morocco, Portugal and Spain) while northern distribution areas could expand (Scotland and Iceland). However, these projections appear related to temperature changes rather than ocean acidification specifically.

The context provides extensive data on Allis shad population status, showing very poor conditions across the OSPAR Maritime Area, with populations extinct in Belgium and critically small in Germany, United Kingdom and Spain. France has lost over 69% of the species' historical geographical range, and there has been dramatic decline in juvenile and adult abundance since 2000 in well-documented populations like the Gironde Basin.

To answer the question about ocean acidification impacts on species, habitats and ecosystems, different source material would be needed.",1,5,0,5
All other assessments,Angel shark,No medata/ pdf,Angel shark.pdf,"Based on the provided context, this OSPAR report does not address climate change. The document is entirely focused on the status assessment of Angel shark populations in the OSPAR maritime area, covering their severe population decline, current threats, and conservation measures.

The report details that Angel sharks have declined by an estimated 58% and disappeared from most of their former range, with losses occurring primarily from the 1960s to 1990s. The identified threats are exclusively related to direct human impacts: excessive mortality from fisheries (particularly accidental capture), habitat damage, and prey availability issues. Fishing mortality through accidental captures, including recreational fisheries, is identified as the main pressure affecting the species.

The assessment focuses on biological factors such as the species' low productivity, limited movements, high site fidelity, and sensitivity to accidental capture. Conservation efforts discussed include EU fishery regulations listing Angel sharks as a prohibited species, national legislation protections, and the Wales Angelshark Action Plan launched in 2020.

Current refuge populations exist in Welsh and Irish waters, specifically in Tralee Bay, Clew Bay, Cardigan Bay, and parts of the Bristol Channel. The report emphasizes that population recovery would only occur over a decadal time-frame due to the species' biological characteristics.

Knowledge gaps identified relate to current range assessment, efficacy of prohibited listings, habitat use, movement patterns, and fishing gear impacts - all direct anthropogenic factors rather than climate-related pressures. No climate change impacts, temperature changes, ocean acidification, or other climate-related stressors are mentioned in this assessment.",1,"The provided context does not contain information about threats or pressures related to climate change. The OSPAR report on angel shark focuses exclusively on other pressures and threats.

The identified threats and pressures are fishing mortality through accidental captures (including recreational fisheries), which is the main pressure affecting all life stages of this low productivity species. Habitat damage represents another key pressure, though the potential impact of habitat deterioration remains undocumented. Prey availability was identified as a threat but is considered likely of limited impact since angel sharks predate on a wide range of demersal fish.

Specific threats include incidental mortality from accidental bycatch in fisheries, possible habitat loss or degradation at Critical Angelshark Areas, and possible low genetic diversity due to population fragmentation. In Tralee Bay, Ireland, angel sharks are particularly vulnerable to static net fisheries targeting crustaceans and are occasionally bycaught in mixed trawl fisheries in St. George's Channel.

Angel sharks have declined severely in the OSPAR Area, with the species lost from large parts of the region from the 1960s to 1990s. The geographic extent has declined by an estimated 58%, with refuge populations remaining only in Welsh and Irish waters within the OSPAR Area. The species remains very sensitive to accidental capture, and their low productivity and limited movements mean any perceptible improvement would only occur over a decadal time-frame.

Climate change-related pressures are not discussed in this assessment, which concentrates on fisheries impacts and habitat degradation from human activities.",1,"The provided context does not address how climate change impacts species, habitats and ecosystems. Instead, the context consists entirely of technical information about angel shark populations in OSPAR marine regions, focusing on their conservation status, population decline, and threats from human activities.

The angel shark assessment documents show that this species has declined severely across OSPAR regions II-IV, with an estimated 58% decline in geographic extent and populations lost from large areas between the 1960s-1990s. The geographic range extends from Scotland and southern Scandinavia to Northwest Africa, the Canary Islands and Mediterranean Sea, with current refuge populations remaining only in Welsh and Irish waters.

The identified threats to angel sharks are excessive mortality from fisheries (particularly accidental bycatch), habitat damage, prey availability impacts, and possible low genetic diversity due to population fragmentation. Fishing mortality through accidental captures in both commercial and recreational fisheries represents the main pressure. The species' low productivity, limited movements, and high site fidelity mean population recovery would only occur over decadal timeframes.

However, none of this information relates to climate change impacts. The context contains no data, analysis, or discussion of climate-related effects on marine species, habitats, or ecosystems. The assessment focuses exclusively on anthropogenic pressures from fishing activities and habitat degradation unrelated to climate factors. To answer the question about climate change impacts on marine systems, different source material containing climate-related marine science data would be required.",1,"The provided context does not contain any information about gaps specifically in relation to climate change. The document focuses entirely on angel shark conservation and identifies several knowledge gaps related to this species, but none are connected to climate change impacts or climate-related research needs.

The knowledge gaps identified in the angel shark assessment include: lack of information on the species' current range and efficacy of prohibited listing; need for dedicated non-destructive surveys of areas of former abundance to inform current habitat and range assessments; requirements for improved liaison and training with the fishing industry for proper specimen release; need for national at-sea observer programmes to collect information on vitality of discarded individuals; and research priorities outlined in the Wales Angelshark Action Plan addressing habitat use, movement patterns, connectivity between populations, impact of different fishing gears, fate of accidentally caught individuals post-release, and current population status.

The potential impact of habitat deterioration remains undocumented, though this gap is not specifically linked to climate change factors. The assessment notes that recent population trends are unknown due to the species' current rarity, and that any perceptible improvement in status would only occur over a decadal timeframe due to the species' low productivity and limited movements.

The context provided is insufficient to answer questions about climate change-related gaps, as the document appears to be focused exclusively on fisheries impacts, habitat conservation, and species protection measures for angel sharks rather than climate change considerations.",1,"The provided context does not address climate change recommendations or climate-related research needs. The context consists entirely of information about angel shark conservation status and management in the OSPAR Maritime Area.

The context focuses on angel shark population decline, with the species having disappeared from most of its former range between the 1960s-1990s due to excessive mortality from fisheries, habitat damage, and prey availability issues. Current recommendations center on fisheries management, including maintaining the prohibited species listing under EU regulations, improving fishing industry training for live release of bycaught specimens, and enhanced at-sea observer programs.

Research gaps identified relate specifically to angel shark biology and conservation: dedicated non-destructive surveys of former abundance areas, assessment of spatial management possibilities, habitat use studies, movement patterns, population connectivity, fishing gear impacts, post-release survival rates, and current population status. The Wales Angelshark Action Plan outlines these priority research questions for addressing evidence gaps.

The assessment acknowledges that population recovery would only occur over decadal timeframes due to the species' low productivity and limited movement capacity. Current protective measures include EU fishery regulations requiring live release of bycaught individuals and some national legislation protections, though the efficacy of the prohibited listing remains unevaluated.

The document appears to be a species-specific assessment focused on direct anthropogenic pressures rather than climate-related environmental changes.",1,"The provided context does not address ocean acidification. The entire document consists of an OSPAR assessment focused exclusively on angel shark populations in the OSPAR Maritime Area. 

The context contains detailed scientific findings about angel shark status, including a 58% decline in geographic extent, with refuge populations remaining only in Welsh and Irish waters within the OSPAR Area. The species has been extirpated from large parts of the OSPAR Area between the 1960s-1990s, with no evidence of status improvement despite protective measures. Key pressures identified include excessive mortality from fisheries bycatch, habitat damage, and prey availability issues. The species now receives the highest possible protection under EU fishery regulations, with prohibited landing requirements.

Current populations are concentrated in specific areas including Tralee Bay, Clew Bay, Cardigan Bay and parts of the Bristol Channel. Recovery expectations remain limited due to the species' low productivity and limited movements, with any improvement requiring decadal timeframes. Priority research gaps include habitat use, movement patterns, connectivity, fishing gear impacts, and post-release survival rates of accidentally caught individuals.

However, none of this information relates to ocean acidification, which involves changes in seawater pH due to increased atmospheric CO2 absorption. The document contains no references to pH levels, carbonate chemistry, acidification processes, or related impacts on marine ecosystems. To answer questions about ocean acidification, different OSPAR reports specifically addressing ocean chemistry and acidification would be required.",1,"The provided context does not address ocean acidification or its impacts on species, habitats and ecosystems. Instead, the context contains a comprehensive assessment of Angel shark populations in the OSPAR Maritime Area, focusing entirely on a single species and the pressures it faces from fishing activities and habitat damage.

The context documents Angel shark as a rare, highly sensitive species that has declined severely across OSPAR regions II-IV during the 20th century, disappearing from large parts of the OSPAR Area between the 1960s-1990s. The geographic extent has declined by an estimated 58%, with refuge populations remaining only in Welsh and Irish waters and outside the OSPAR Area. The species disappeared from most of its former range, becoming depleted in the Northeast Atlantic.

The primary pressures identified are excessive mortality from fisheries (particularly accidental capture and bycatch), habitat damage, and prey availability issues. All life stages of this low productivity stock are susceptible to capture in commercial and recreational fisheries. The potential impact of habitat deterioration remains undocumented, while prey availability is considered of limited impact given the species' ability to predate on a wide range of demersal fish.

Current knowledge gaps include lack of information on the species' current range, habitat use, movement patterns, connectivity, and the efficacy of protective measures. The low productivity and high site fidelity of Angel shark means population recovery would only occur over decadal time-frames.

All other assessments,Aquaculture,No medata/ pdf,Aquaculture.pdf,"Climate change represents a significant uncertainty for aquaculture in the OSPAR Maritime Area, with both positive and negative impacts anticipated. The EU-funded CERES project analyzed direct effects of changing temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen concentration and salinity, plus indirect effects including disease, algal blooms, and jellyfish occurrence. Their synthesis report examined productivity impacts by mid-century and end-century for finfish and bivalve species, showing projected impacts vary according to different scenarios and sectors.

Negative impacts include production or infrastructure loss from extreme events, diseases, toxic algae and parasites; decreased productivity from suboptimal farming conditions; environmental factors affecting natural oyster spat or mussel seed production; compromised control of salmon farming issues like sea lice and escapees; limited feed access; site loss from sea level rise; and ocean acidification effects on shellfish. Climate change increases storm event risks, potentially causing more farmed fish escapes with genetic and disease transmission impacts on wild populations.

Specific regional examples show complexity: Norwegian salmon aquaculture faces vulnerability to temperature rises exceeding thermal optima and extreme heat waves, though some areas may see positive growth effects. UK temperature increases likely boost growth rates for most farmed species, but sea lice and gill disease in salmon, harmful algal blooms, and jellyfish swarms will worsen. In north-west Spain, higher temperatures and increasing summer northerly winds could benefit mussel aquaculture but also increase harmful algae, while extreme weather events could cause mussel detachment or raft loss.

Technical and management changes in the rapidly evolving aquaculture industry make long-term climate change impacts difficult to forecast, with socio-economic outcomes and adaptation strategies challenging to assess given diverse farming sites and evolving technology.",5,"Climate change represents a significant uncertainty for marine aquaculture, with impacts varying according to different scenarios and sectors. The EU-funded CERES project identified direct effects from changes in temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen concentration and salinity, plus indirect effects including disease, algal blooms, and jellyfish.

Multiple negative impacts threaten aquaculture operations. Extreme weather events can cause loss of production and infrastructure, with climate change potentially increasing risks of storm events that lead to fish escapes. In Norway, salmon aquaculture faces vulnerability to temperature rises exceeding thermal optima, particularly during heat waves. Sea lice and gill disease in salmon are likely to worsen, along with harmful algal blooms and jellyfish swarms affecting UK farmed species. Ocean acidification poses specific threats to shellfish production, while sea level rise threatens site availability. Environmental factors may disrupt natural production of oyster spat and mussel seed. Climate change could limit access to marine and terrestrial feed sources and reduce productivity through suboptimal farming conditions.

However, positive impacts also exist. Temperature increases could enhance growth rates for most UK farmed species and benefit mussel aquaculture in northwest Spain through higher temperatures and increased summer northerly winds, though this could simultaneously increase harmful algae. In Norway, some areas may experience positive effects on salmon growth rates.

The complexity of impacts makes assessment challenging. Technical and management changes in the rapidly evolving aquaculture industry make long-term climate change impacts difficult to forecast. Socio-economic outcomes and adaptation strategies remain difficult to assess given the diversity of farming sites and evolving technology.

Temperature increases affect thermal optima for species, with salmon aquaculture vulnerable to temperature rises exceeding optimal ranges, particularly during extreme heat wave events, though some areas may experience positive effects on growth rates. Temperature increases will likely enhance growth rates for most UK farmed species, but simultaneously worsen problems with sea lice and gill disease in salmon, harmful algal blooms, and jellyfish swarms.

Ocean acidification directly affects shellfish by impacting their shell formation and survival. Sea level rise threatens coastal sites and infrastructure. Extreme weather events cause multiple impacts including infrastructure damage, mussel detachment, loss of mussel rafts, increased storm-related fish escapes, and facility destruction. These events also increase risks of farm escapees, which threaten wild fish populations through genetic impacts, interbreeding, competition for spawning grounds, and disease transmission.

Climate change affects natural productivity cycles, disrupting environmental factors controlling oyster spat and mussel seed production. Disease patterns shift, with climate potentially influencing sea lice interactions with wild hosts and increasing disease transmission risks. Harmful algal bloom frequency and intensity increase, creating toxic conditions and affecting water quality.

Habitat destruction occurs through multiple mechanisms: organic waste accumulation affects sediment chemistry and benthic organisms, nutrient enrichment through nitrate, ammonia, phosphate and organic carbon leads to local eutrophication, and physical cage impacts damage seabed habitats. Ecosystem functioning changes through altered biogeochemical cycling, with aquaculture nutrients contributing significantly to marine nutrient cycles, particularly in areas with low freshwater inputs.",4,"The report identifies several significant knowledge gaps related to climate change and aquaculture. Socio-economic outcomes and adaptation strategies are difficult to assess due to the diversity of farming sites and evolving technology. Technical and management changes in the rapidly evolving aquaculture industry make long-term impacts of climate change difficult to forecast.

Specific uncertainties include the potential influence of climate change on sea lice and their interaction with wild hosts, population level impacts of lice on wild fish, and the fate, persistence and toxicity of chemical treatments for lice. Climate change could add to the risks of storm events, affecting escapes of farmed fish and infrastructure damage.

Understanding of possible impacts from seaweed aquaculture expansion, including disease, alteration in population genetics and alterations to the physio-chemical environment, still needs to be developed. For finfish aquaculture moving toward more dispersive, high current sites including open ocean installations, more understanding of regional effects and impacts on hard bottom sites is required.

The complexity of climate change impacts varies according to different scenarios and sectors. While the CERES project has developed tools to project occurrence and risk of indirect effects such as disease, algal blooms, and jellyfish, and provided productivity projections by mid-century and end-century for certain species, significant gaps remain in predicting socio-economic consequences. Only Spain and Norway had strategic plans for aquaculture growth extending to 2030-2050, indicating limited long-term climate adaptation planning across most countries.",5,"The report identifies climate change as a significant uncertainty for aquaculture with complex impacts requiring targeted responses.

However, positive impacts are also possible, such as temperature increases likely boosting growth rates for most UK farmed species and benefiting mussel aquaculture in north-west Spain.

The FutureEUAqua project recommends developing climate-change resilient, environmentally-friendly aquaculture through genetic selection, improved ingredients and feeds, monitoring technologies, innovative products, and optimal production systems. The CERES project has developed tools projecting climate change risks including disease, algal blooms, and jellyfish occurrence, while analyzing productivity impacts on finfish and bivalve species by mid- and end-century across different scenarios.

Key research gaps requiring investigation include: the influence of climate change on sea lice and their wild host interactions; climate change effects on storm event risks increasing fish escapes; ecological carrying capacity assessments; impacts of different bivalve culture methods in varying environments; and unexplained variation in seed mussel availability. Technical and management changes in the rapidly evolving aquaculture industry make long-term climate change impact forecasting particularly difficult, with socio-economic outcomes and adaptation strategies challenging to assess given diverse farming sites and evolving technology.",5,"Ocean acidification is identified as one of several climate change-related threats affecting aquaculture in the OSPAR Maritime Area. The report specifically identifies ocean acidification's effect on shellfish as a possible negative impact for marine aquaculture operations.

The EU-funded CERES project reviewed climate change impacts on European aquaculture, examining direct effects including changes in pH levels alongside temperature, dissolved oxygen concentration, and salinity. This project developed tools to project the occurrence and risk of both direct and indirect climate effects on aquaculture systems.

Ocean acidification is mentioned specifically in the context of shellfish aquaculture, which depends heavily on natural environmental conditions for feed supply. The report notes that shellfish culture can potentially provide positive ecosystem services through carbon sequestration and nutrient removal, but ocean acidification represents a threat that could undermine these operations and their environmental benefits.

The analysis indicates that climate change impacts, including ocean acidification, create significant uncertainty for aquaculture planning. Technical and management changes in the rapidly evolving aquaculture industry make long-term climate change impacts, including acidification effects, difficult to forecast accurately.

The CERES project's synthesis report examined productivity scenarios for finfish and bivalve species used in aquaculture by mid-century and end-century, considering various climate factors including pH changes.

All other assessments,Atlantic salmon,No medata/ pdf,Atlantic salmon.pdf,"Climate change emerges as an expanding threat to Atlantic salmon populations across OSPAR regions, with impacts occurring during both freshwater and marine life phases. Most future climatic scenarios predict higher temperatures and increased extreme events including flooding and drought, raising concerns about effects on salmon feeding, growth, survival, and migratory routes.

Rising sea temperatures have already altered salmon migration patterns, with populations extending their routes farther north into Arctic waters. This particularly affects southern populations in Portugal and Spain, which must now travel longer distances to reach appropriate foraging areas. However, temperature effects are not uniform - rising water temperatures may increase marine survival for some stocks while decreasing it for others.

Specific climate impacts include a documented salmon recruitment crash in Wales in 2016 caused by warm spawning temperatures and high river flows during early life stages. The loss of thermal suitability in riverine habitats represents a growing threat requiring adaptive management measures such as planting riparian trees for solar shading.

Climate-induced changes have further aggravated effects on specific Atlantic salmon populations, especially in southern OSPAR regions. Climate change also raises concerns about expanding distributions of invasive pink salmon, though population-level competition impacts with Atlantic salmon remain unclear.

Despite these documented effects, significant knowledge gaps persist. Limited data exists on the extent of climate change effects on Atlantic salmon individuals, stocks, populations, and management units.

A salmon recruitment crash occurred in Wales in 2016 due to warm spawning temperatures and high river flows during earliest life stages. Rising water temperatures produce non-uniform effects, with potential for increased marine survival in some stocks while decreasing survival in others.

Climate-induced changes in marine environments are altering migration patterns, with salmon populations extending routes farther north as sea temperatures rise. This particularly affects southern populations in Portugal and Spain, which must travel longer distances to encounter appropriate foraging areas. These populations face heightened vulnerability if unable to adapt to extended migration routes.

Riverine habitats are losing thermal suitability, representing a growing threat requiring adaptive management measures such as planting riparian trees for solar shading. Climate-induced changes have particularly aggravated effects on Atlantic salmon populations in southern OSPAR regions.

Long-term impacts include reductions in body size, condition, and changes in growth metrics. There is common reduction in individual and population condition across all regions, including loss of weight, length and reproductive potential, though data remain limited for many populations.

Data are lacking to enable assessment of all potential effects from small-scale hydropower stations, which require further study as these programs expand across several countries. Very few data exist on the combined effects from multiple pressures during different life stages, even small effects that could be detrimental for Atlantic salmon survival. Assessing causes of marine mortality in Atlantic salmon remains very challenging.

Population-level impacts from species competition are still unclear, requiring more data and studies, with growing concern under climate change conditions. The area of thermal habitat management requires detailed understanding of spatio-temporal variability of phenomena affecting salmonids and their environments.

Further data collection and harmonization are needed to better acknowledge impacts of non-fisheries threats on Atlantic salmon status. Studies are required to acknowledge impacts of native predators on Atlantic salmon survival. The potential threat of small-scale hydropower stations needs further study and probably better legislation to protect key habitats in some countries.

Climate change represents an emerging and expanding threat that will be a key challenge for managers and scientists in coming years. The loss of thermal suitability of riverine habitats is a growing threat requiring managers to adapt future mitigation measures, particularly in southern OSPAR regions where climate-induced changes may have further aggravated effects on specific Atlantic salmon populations.",5,"The report identifies expanding climate change impacts as a continuing concern for Atlantic salmon populations and recommends several adaptive management measures. Managers may need to adapt future mitigation measures in areas experiencing loss of thermal suitability of riverine habitats, such as planting riparian trees to provide solar shading. Management processes should include concerted and coordinated international actions to regulate fisheries and maintain river health, particularly where migratory fish cross international boundaries.

Future climatic scenarios predict higher temperatures and increased extreme events (flooding and drought), causing growing concern over effects on salmon feeding, growth, survival and migratory routes. Rising sea temperatures are forcing salmon migration routes to extend farther north, potentially affecting populations unable to adapt to longer migration routes, especially southern populations in Portugal and Spain that may need to travel longer distances to encounter appropriate foraging areas.

Acidification was once a major concern, particularly in the northernmost OSPAR regions (I and II), where it caused premature mortality of wild Atlantic salmon and extirpation of some populations. However, acidification and acid rain have decreased over the past decade.

This improvement stems from significant reductions in emissions of all key air pollutants. For sulphur dioxide, the most important acidifying compound, European emissions have decreased by 80% or more since peaks around 1980-1990. Additionally, liming has made an important contribution to restoring salmon populations in formerly acidified rivers in Norway and Sweden.

The context focuses on Atlantic salmon population status, which remains poor across all OSPAR regions (I-IV). Population abundance has declined to historically low levels, with common trends showing reduction in individual and population condition including loss of weight, length and reproductive potential. More than 2,000 genetically distinct salmon populations are distributed in water courses flowing towards the North Atlantic Ocean.

Climate change effects on Atlantic salmon include impacts on feeding, growth, survival and migratory routes during both freshwater and marine life phases. Rising water temperatures affect marine survival differently across stocks, with potential increases for some and decreases for others.

The distribution range expanded northwards during the 1990s and early 2000s, driven by prey shifts that resulted from increased sea surface temperatures. This northward range expansion has been proposed as climate-driven and may have implications for population dynamics, though further evidence is required to establish definitive causation.

The species faces challenges in assessment due to climate-related impacts on prey distribution. Major congregation areas shift between years, presumably linked to changes in prey distribution and availability, making trend establishment particularly difficult in the OSPAR Area. These distribution changes at small and mid-scale related to prey availability, combined with the overall northward shift in range, complicate proper assessment of population trends in the non-breeding range.

Tracking data reveals that adult birds do not move further north than North-Western France, suggesting that birds occurring in South-Western UK and South-Eastern Ireland are juveniles and immature individuals - indicating the northward expansion primarily affects younger age classes.

Climate change is identified as an influence requiring urgent attention alongside other emerging threats like windfarm development and plastic pollution impacts. The influence of climate change on the species should be addressed through future research priorities, as current understanding remains incomplete.

The species' distribution range expanded northwards during the 1990s and early 2000s, driven by prey shifts caused by increasing sea surface temperatures. Climate change has been proposed as prompting a continued northward expansion of the species' range, which may have implications for population dynamics, though further evidence is needed to confirm these effects.

The northward range expansion creates challenges for population assessment, as changes in distribution at small and mid-scale levels related to prey availability, combined with the overall northward shift, make it difficult to properly assess population trends in the non-breeding range. The species exhibits shifts in major congregation areas between years, presumably linked to changes in prey distribution and availability, which may be climate-related.

Climate change influences are specifically identified among new and increasing potential threats that require attention, alongside offshore windfarm development and plastic pollution impacts. The report emphasizes that the influence of climate change on the species should be addressed as a priority research and conservation concern.

The climate-driven changes in prey distribution and availability contribute to the species' vulnerability, particularly given its highly congregatory coastal behavior and low resilience due to life history traits including longevity and slow reproduction rates. However, information gaps exist regarding the full extent of climate change impacts, with the assessment noting that further evidence is needed to understand the complete implications of climate-driven range expansion on population dynamics.",4,"Climate change impacts on the Balearic shearwater demonstrate several key effects on marine species distribution and behavior. Sea surface temperature increases drove prey shifts that prompted a northward expansion of the species' distribution range during the 1990s and early 2000s.

The northward range expansion has potential implications for population dynamics, though further evidence is needed to fully understand these effects. Adult birds tracked by researchers do not move further north than North-Western France, suggesting that individuals occurring in South-Western UK and South-Eastern Ireland are likely juveniles and immature birds responding differently to climate-driven changes.

Climate change complicates population trend assessments due to the wide range occupied by the species and shifts in major congregation areas between years, which are presumably linked to changes in prey distribution and availability. These climate-induced distributional changes make it difficult to properly assess population trends in the non-breeding range.

The influence of climate change represents one of several increasing threats requiring attention, alongside windfarm development and plastic pollution impacts.

The report documents a northward distribution increase in the 1990s and early 2000s, presumably related to prey shifts driven by rising sea surface temperatures. However, establishing clear trends remains challenging due to the species' wide range and shifting congregation areas between years, presumably linked to changes in prey distribution and availability.

Critical data deficiencies include incomplete information on food availability and its potential impacts on the species. This gap is particularly significant given that prey shifts appear to be climate-driven and influence the species' distribution patterns. The assessment acknowledges that changes in distribution at small and mid-scale related to prey availability, combined with the overall northward shift in range, make it difficult to properly assess trends in the non-breeding range.

Data on abundance patterns and trends across the entire OSPAR Maritime Area remain patchy and require more coordinated action. Information on juvenile distribution patterns is completely missing, representing another significant gap.

Coastal development, pollution, and bottom fishing affect coastal water quality and food sources of this filter-feeding species, which compounds climate pressures. Basking sharks are plankton feeders often associated with high levels of chlorophyll and surface aggregations of zooplankton, particularly along tidal and shelf-break fronts, making them vulnerable to climate-driven changes in prey distribution and abundance.

The species inhabits boreal to warm-temperate waters globally, with documented transatlantic and transequatorial migrations as well as movements into tropical areas and mesopelagic depths. This extensive migratory behavior suggests potential sensitivity to changing ocean conditions across their range.

However, significant knowledge gaps exist regarding climate impacts. The assessment specifically identifies that impacts of range shifts in prey species, ocean warming, and acidification require investigation. Current data from sighting schemes show large inter-annual variations in occurrence and relative abundance, but these do not allow identification of clear population trends, making it difficult to assess climate change effects definitively. The pronounced migratory character and vulnerability of the species underlines the need to strengthen knowledge of its current status in relation to climate pressures.",4,"The report identifies several climate change-related threats and pressures affecting basking sharks. Research supports the hypothesis that small-scale behavioral responses in basking sharks are linked to broad-scale responses to climate changes. This connection between local behaviors and larger climate-driven changes represents a significant pressure on the species.

Ocean warming and acidification pose direct threats that require investigation, particularly regarding their impacts on basking shark populations. Climate change also creates indirect pressures through range shifts in prey species, which could affect food availability for these filter-feeding sharks. Since basking sharks are plankton feeders often associated with high chlorophyll levels and surface zooplankton aggregations, particularly along tidal and shelf-break fronts, changes in prey distribution patterns could significantly impact their feeding success.

The report identifies coastal development, pollution, and bottom fishing as additional pressures that affect coastal water quality and food sources of this filter-feeding species, though these are primarily anthropogenic rather than climate-related threats.

Climate change pressures are considered significant enough that the report specifically recommends investigating the impacts of range shifts in prey species alongside ocean warming and acidification effects. This recommendation indicates that climate-related threats are recognized as priority research areas for basking shark conservation.

The combination of direct climate effects (warming and acidification) and indirect effects (prey distribution changes) represents a multi-faceted climate change pressure on basking shark populations, though the report notes that quantitative assessments of these impacts remain a knowledge gap requiring further investigation.",4,"Based on the provided context, which focuses specifically on basking sharks, climate change impacts species through several key mechanisms:

**Species-level impacts**: Behavioural responses at small scales are linked to broad-scale responses to climate changes, affecting how individual animals adapt their feeding and movement patterns. Ocean warming and acidification create direct physiological stresses on marine species.

**Habitat degradation**: Climate change drives changes in zooplankton composition, which directly affects filter-feeding species like basking sharks that depend on specific prey assemblages. Coastal water quality deteriorates as temperatures and chemistry change, further degrading critical feeding habitats.

**Ecosystem-wide effects**: Range shifts in prey species disrupt established predator-prey relationships and food web dynamics. As prey distributions change in response to warming waters, predators must either follow these shifts or face reduced food availability. This creates cascading effects throughout marine ecosystems.

**Food web disruption**: Changes in zooplankton composition alter the base of marine food webs. Filter-feeding species face particular challenges as their specialized feeding strategies become mismatched with changing prey availability and distribution patterns.

**Research gaps identified**: The impacts of range shifts in prey species, ocean warming, and acidification require further investigation to fully understand their combined effects on marine species and ecosystems.

The context indicates these climate impacts compound other human pressures like coastal development, pollution, and fishing activities, creating cumulative stress on marine ecosystems. However, the specific mechanisms and quantitative impacts across different species groups and ecosystem types require additional research to establish comprehensive understanding.",4,"The report identifies a critical knowledge gap regarding climate change impacts on basking sharks that requires urgent investigation. Specifically, the impacts of range shifts in prey species as well as ocean warming and acidification should be investigated as a priority research need.

Research supports the hypothesis that behavioral responses at small scales are linked by broad-scale responses to climate changes. This suggests that climate change effects operate across multiple spatial scales, affecting both local behaviors and broader distribution patterns of basking sharks.

Climate change impacts are compounded by other pressures affecting this filter-feeding species. Coastal development, pollution and bottom fishing affect coastal water quality and food sources, which could interact with climate-driven changes to create cumulative effects on basking shark populations.

The species' pronounced migratory character and vulnerability underlines the need to strengthen knowledge of current status, particularly as climate change may alter migration patterns and habitat suitability. Current data sets from sighting schemes indicate large inter-annual variations in occurrence and relative abundance but do not allow identification of clear population trends, making it difficult to distinguish climate-driven changes from natural variability.

Additional knowledge gaps compound the climate change uncertainty: quantification of bycatch and discard survival rates have not been estimated, migratory patterns and population structure require further study, and the importance of individual gatherings in the OSPAR Region remains unknown at the global scale, though they might be associated with critical areas linked to foraging or reproduction that could be climate-sensitive.

The current population status remains unknown despite increased knowledge over the past 11 years, and international coordination of measures is still needed to address these interconnected pressures including climate change.",4,"Regarding climate change recommendations for basking sharks, the report identifies several key areas requiring investigation and research. The impacts of range shifts in prey species as well as ocean warming and acidification should be investigated as priority research areas. This recommendation stems from evidence that coastal development, pollution and bottom fishing affect coastal water quality and food sources of this filter-feeding species, with research supporting the hypothesis that behavioural responses at small scales are linked by broad-scale responses to climate changes.

The report highlights significant knowledge gaps that require further study. Migratory patterns and population structure should be further studied, particularly given the pronounced migratory character and vulnerability of this species. The importance of individual gatherings of basking sharks in the OSPAR Region remains unknown at the global scale, though they might be associated with critical areas linked to foraging or reproduction.

Additional research needs include quantification of bycatch, fate and discarding in numbers and estimated weight, as discard survival rates have not been estimated. Special attention should be drawn to any coastal development project, and potential habitat and/or hotspots should be included in national or regional marine spatial planning frameworks.

The context reveals that basking sharks are plankton feeders often associated with high levels of chlorophyll and surface aggregations of zooplankton, making them particularly vulnerable to climate-driven changes in prey distribution. Despite increased knowledge over the past 11 years, current population status remains unknown, and international coordination of measures is still needed to address these climate-related challenges effectively.",4,"The context provided is from an OSPAR assessment of basking sharks and contains very limited information specifically about ocean acidification. Ocean acidification is mentioned only as a factor requiring investigation alongside ocean warming. Specifically, the report identifies that impacts of range shifts in prey species as well as ocean warming and acidification should be investigated in relation to basking sharks.

The context does not provide any direct findings, measurements, trends, or detailed analysis of ocean acidification itself. The reference appears in the context of recommended future research priorities rather than as substantive findings about acidification impacts or status in the OSPAR Maritime Area.

The document focuses primarily on basking shark population status, threats, and management measures. It notes that basking sharks are plankton feeders associated with high chlorophyll levels and surface zooplankton aggregations, and that coastal development, pollution and bottom fishing affect coastal water quality and food sources of this filter-feeding species. Research supports that behavioral responses at small scales are linked to broad-scale climate changes, but no specific acidification effects are detailed.

The assessment methodology was based on ICES examination of catch and effort data, peer-reviewed literature, and expert opinion, but the provided context does not include any substantive findings about ocean acidification from these sources. The document identifies acidification as a research gap rather than providing analysis of its current or projected impacts.",2,"Based on the provided context, the specific impacts of ocean acidification on species, habitats and ecosystems are not detailed in this OSPAR report. The context consists entirely of a basking shark assessment that only briefly mentions ocean acidification as a factor requiring investigation.

The report identifies that impacts of ocean warming and acidification on basking sharks should be investigated, particularly regarding range shifts in their prey species. However, no specific mechanisms, effects, or data about acidification impacts are provided. The assessment focuses primarily on other pressures affecting basking sharks, including coastal development, pollution, and bottom fishing that affect coastal water quality and food sources of this filter-feeding species.

Basking sharks are plankton feeders associated with high chlorophyll levels and surface aggregations of zooplankton, particularly along tidal and shelf-break fronts. The species exhibits behavioral responses at small scales that are linked to broad-scale climate changes, but the specific role of acidification in these responses is not elaborated.

The assessment acknowledges significant knowledge gaps remain regarding basking sharks, including understanding how ocean acidification specifically affects this species and its prey. The report recommends investigating acidification impacts on prey species range shifts but provides no current data or findings about these effects.

The context therefore cannot provide a comprehensive answer about ocean acidification's impacts on marine species, habitats, and ecosystems generally, as it contains only this single species assessment with limited mention of acidification as an area requiring future research rather than presenting current scientific findings about acidification effects.",2,0,0,1
All other assessments,Black-legged kittiwake,No medata/ pdf,Black-legged kittiwake.pdf,"Climate change is having significant impacts on Black-legged kittiwake populations across the OSPAR maritime area through both direct and indirect mechanisms. Climate change continues to affect food supply in the Arctic, Greater North Sea and Iberian Coast by reducing sandeel abundance, which constitutes the kittiwakes' primary prey. This food supply reduction is driving ongoing population declines, with threats to sandeel availability from climate change persisting in the Arctic and Greater North Sea regions.

Climate change is causing observable shifts in breeding distribution, with the southern edge of the breeding range in the Celtic Seas constricting northwards. All colonies have disappeared from Brittany in northwest France during the last decade, and many other colonies have been lost. A northward contraction in breeding range in the Bay of Biscay and Celtic Seas aligns with climate change predictions. Modeling indicates that by 2100, the climate in the eastern North Sea, Bay of Biscay and Iberian Coast will no longer be suitable for breeding kittiwakes.

However, climate impacts vary regionally. In the Celtic Seas, no evidence suggests climate change is driving food supply reductions in the same manner as other regions. Current low sandeel availability may be more attributable to competition and predation by larger fish than climate-induced temperature changes. Climate appears to affect kittiwakes indirectly by reducing prey abundance rather than through direct physiological impacts. The assessment identifies a critical knowledge gap regarding understanding the links between climate change, lower trophic levels and kittiwake population status.",4,"Climate change poses significant threats to Black-legged Kittiwakes through multiple pathways. The primary impact occurs through disruption of food supply, specifically affecting sandeel availability in the Arctic and Greater North Sea regions. These food supply threats from climate change are continuing across the Arctic, Greater North Sea, and Iberian Coast.

Climate change is driving observable range shifts, with the southern edge of the breeding range in Celtic Seas constricting northwards, consistent with climate predictions. Modelling indicates that by 2100, climatic conditions in the eastern North Sea and Bay of Biscay/Iberian Coast will no longer be suitable for breeding kittiwakes. A northward contraction in breeding range across Bay of Biscay and Celtic Seas appears consistent with climate change predictions, representing part of a broader northward shift.

However, climate impacts vary regionally. In Celtic Seas, no evidence suggests climate change is driving food supply reductions in the same manner as other regions. Current low sandeel availability may be more driven by competition and predation from larger fish rather than climate-induced temperature changes, though this remains debated.

Climate affects kittiwakes indirectly by reducing prey abundance, particularly in the Bay of Biscay where only few breeding pairs remain. The species shows particular vulnerability due to life history characteristics - being long-lived with slow reproduction rates, making recovery from climate-induced pressures slow.

The assessment identifies a critical knowledge gap requiring greater understanding of links between climate change, lower trophic levels, and kittiwake population status. Climate change represents both direct pressures through breeding distribution shifts and indirect pressures through reduced food supply availability.",5,"Climate change impacts Black-legged Kittiwake species through both direct and indirect mechanisms. The primary indirect impact occurs through reduced food supply, with threats to sandeel availability continuing in the Arctic and Greater North Sea regions. Climate change also affects food supply in the Iberian Coast, where a collapse in sardine availability in 1991 caused population declines in Spain.

Direct impacts manifest as shifts in breeding distribution, with a documented northward contraction occurring in the Bay of Biscay and Celtic Seas. The southern edge of the breeding range in Celtic Seas is constricting northwards, consistent with climate change predictions. All colonies have disappeared from Brittany in northwest France during the last 10 years, and many colonies along the southwest coast of the UK have gone extinct.

Modelling predicts that by 2100, the climate in the eastern North Sea, Bay of Biscay, and Iberian Coast will no longer be suitable for breeding kittiwakes. Currently, only a few pairs remain breeding in the entire Bay of Biscay region, where climate is affecting them indirectly by reducing prey abundance.

Population impacts are severe, with breeding numbers declining from approximately 1.8 million pairs in 1991 to only 600,000 pairs by 2015-2020 across monitored areas. Arctic waters experienced the most substantial decline at 70%. Very few kittiwakes have bred in some regions since 2010, and some large colonies in the Norwegian Sea have gone extinct due to poor food supply combined with increased predation. The assessment identifies a need for greater understanding of links between climate change, lower trophic levels, and kittiwake population status.",4,"The OSPAR report identifies several critical knowledge gaps related to climate change impacts on kittiwakes. The assessment of threats would benefit from a greater understanding of the links between climate change, lower trophic levels and kittiwake population status, predation risks and movements. Additionally, the pilot assessment of kittiwake status at sea outside the breeding season is limited to only the southern part of the Greater North Sea, representing a significant geographic gap.

Geographic data gaps compound climate change research limitations, with breeding population assessments lacking data from Greenland, Iceland and the Faroes in Arctic Waters, and missing data from Ireland in the Celtic Seas. These gaps are particularly problematic given that climate change appears to be continuing to affect food supply in the Arctic, Greater North Sea and the Iberian Coast.

The report reveals conflicting evidence about climate change mechanisms. While threats to kittiwakes' food supply of sandeels from climate change appear to be continuing in the Arctic and Greater North Sea, current low availability of sandeels is more likely driven by competition and predation by larger fish than by climate change-induced temperature changes. However, there is no evidence from the Celtic Seas suggesting climate change is driving food supply reductions in the same way.

Climate modeling predicts that by 2100, the climate in the eastern North Sea and Bay of Biscay and Iberian Coast will no longer be suitable for breeding kittiwakes. The observed northward contraction in breeding range in Bay of Biscay and Celtic Seas appears consistent with these climate change predictions, yet the mechanistic understanding of these range shifts remains incomplete.",5,"Based on the OSPAR report's findings regarding Black-legged Kittiwake populations, several climate change-related issues require urgent investigation and research attention.

Climate change threats to kittiwakes' sandeel food supply continue in the Arctic and Greater North Sea regions. Modelling indicates that by 2100, the climate in the eastern North Sea and Bay of Biscay/Iberian Coast will no longer be suitable for breeding kittiwakes. A northward contraction in breeding range across Bay of Biscay and Celtic Seas is consistent with climate change predictions, with the southern edge of breeding range in Celtic Seas constricting northwards.

The report identifies critical research gaps requiring investigation. A greater understanding of the links between climate change, lower trophic levels and kittiwake population status is needed, along with better knowledge of predation risks and movements. The assessment would benefit from expanded monitoring of kittiwakes at sea outside breeding season, currently limited to the southern Greater North Sea.

Significant data gaps exist for breeding populations in Arctic Waters (lacking data from Greenland, Iceland and the Faroes) and Celtic Seas (lacking Irish data). The current low availability of sandeels may be driven more by competition and predation from larger fish than climate-induced temperature changes, though this remains contested.

Climate change affects kittiwakes both directly through shifts in breeding distribution and indirectly through reduced food supply. In the Bay of Biscay region, climate is probably affecting populations indirectly by reducing prey abundance. However, no evidence suggests climate change is driving food supply reductions in Celtic Seas in the same manner as other regions.",4,"Based on the provided OSPAR report context, ocean acidification is not discussed or mentioned. The context focuses entirely on the status and threats to Black-legged Kittiwake breeding populations across OSPAR maritime regions.

The report extensively covers climate change impacts on kittiwakes, but specifically addresses temperature-related effects rather than ocean acidification. Climate change threatens kittiwake food supply of sandeels in the Arctic and Greater North Sea, with modelling predicting that by 2100, the climate in the eastern North Sea and Bay of Biscay will no longer be suitable for breeding kittiwakes. A northward contraction in breeding range across Bay of Biscay and Celtic Seas is consistent with climate change predictions, and only a few breeding pairs now remain in the entire Bay of Biscay region.

The report identifies climate change as affecting kittiwakes both directly through shifts in breeding distribution and indirectly through reduced food supply. However, these impacts are attributed to temperature changes affecting prey abundance rather than ocean chemistry changes. The current low availability of sandeels is attributed more to competition and predation by larger fish than to climate-induced temperature changes.

The context contains no information about ocean acidification, its effects on marine ecosystems, pH changes in seawater, or impacts on marine species' calcium carbonate structures. The climate-related discussions focus exclusively on temperature effects on species distribution and food web dynamics.",1,"The provided context does not address ocean acidification impacts on species, habitats and ecosystems. The context exclusively focuses on Black-legged Kittiwake populations and their responses to climate change pressures, but ocean acidification is not mentioned anywhere in the material.

The context documents climate change impacts on marine birds, specifically showing that Black-legged Kittiwake breeding populations declined substantially from 1.8 million pairs in 1991 to 600,000 pairs by 2015-2020 across all four monitored OSPAR regions. Climate change affects kittiwakes primarily through reduced food supply, with threats to sandeel availability continuing in Arctic Waters and the Greater North Sea. Food supply collapses have occurred, such as sardine collapse in 1991 that caused Spanish population declines.

Climate-driven range shifts are occurring, with the southern breeding range edge contracting northward in Celtic Seas and Bay of Biscay. Modelling predicts that by 2100, climate in the eastern North Sea, Bay of Biscay and Iberian Coast will no longer be suitable for breeding kittiwakes. Some large Norwegian Sea colonies have gone extinct due to poor food supply and increased predation.

While these findings demonstrate significant climate impacts on marine ecosystems through changes in species distribution, abundance, and food webs, they do not provide information about ocean acidification specifically. The context reveals climate change affects marine food supply and predator-prey relationships, but lacks data on pH changes, carbonate chemistry, or acidification effects on calcifying organisms that would be needed to answer the original question about ocean acidification impacts.",1,14,0,14
All other assessments,Blue whale,No medata/ pdf,Blue whale.pdf,"Climate change represents a key anthropogenic pressure on blue whales, with impacts including indirect consequences such as changes in prey availability. Potential climate change impacts on the marine ecosystem remain poorly understood. Specifically, changes in ocean acidity, water temperature and currents could lead to a reduction in prey species that blue whales depend upon.

Blue whales face particular vulnerability to climate change effects due to their biological characteristics - they are long-lived with low reproductive rates and low population density. Their migration patterns involve movement from tropical and sub-tropical areas in winter to higher latitudes in summer, potentially making them susceptible to climate-driven changes in ocean conditions across these ranges.

The Northeast Atlantic population around Iceland shows some positive trends, with abundance estimates increasing from 222 animals in 1987 to 3,000 in 2015, possibly indicating population recovery despite ongoing climate pressures. However, current abundance for the Northeast Atlantic overall remains unknown, and the species is still considered rare in this region.

Actions related to climate change might benefit the species, though the specific nature of these actions is not detailed. The assessment acknowledges significant knowledge gaps regarding how climate change impacts are affecting blue whales specifically. There is insufficient information on how climate change, along with other human activities like shipping and noise production, is impacting this species. Future climate-driven increases in Arctic shipping activity may compound existing threats through increased ship strike risks as climate change opens new maritime routes.",4,"Climate change represents a significant but poorly understood threat to blue whales in the OSPAR Maritime Area. Climate change impacts on the marine ecosystem remain poorly understood, but specific mechanisms have been identified through which climate change could negatively affect blue whale populations.

Ocean acidification, water temperature changes, and alterations in ocean currents could lead to reductions in prey availability for blue whales. Since blue whales depend on specific prey species and feeding conditions, these environmental changes pose direct risks to their survival and recovery. Climate change is explicitly listed among the key anthropogenic pressures affecting the species, alongside ship strikes, underwater noise, fishing-related resource depletion, and entanglement.

The report identifies climate change as having both direct and indirect consequences for blue whale populations, including changes in the species' distribution patterns. Given that blue whales undertake extensive migrations between tropical and subtropical wintering areas and higher latitude summer feeding grounds, climate-driven changes in ocean conditions could disrupt these essential movement patterns and feeding behaviors.

Current abundance estimates around Iceland show approximately 3,000 animals as of 2015, with evidence suggesting population increases since earlier surveys. However, the long-lived nature of blue whales, combined with their low reproductive rates and low population density, makes them particularly vulnerable to climate change impacts. Their slow recovery rate means that climate-related population changes may only become visible after decades.

The assessment acknowledges significant knowledge gaps regarding how climate change specifically impacts blue whale populations, emphasizing the need for improved understanding of these climate-related pressures on marine ecosystems.",4,"Climate change impacts on marine species, habitats and ecosystems remain poorly understood. However, specific mechanisms have been identified that demonstrate significant potential for ecosystem disruption.

Changes in ocean acidity, water temperature and ocean currents could lead to reduction in prey availability, directly affecting marine food webs. These alterations fundamentally impact ecosystem structure by disrupting the foundation of marine food chains.

For marine species, climate change creates cascading effects through both direct and indirect pathways. Blue whales, as an example of long-lived marine species, face climate change pressures through changes in feeding conditions and prey distribution. Their sensitivity is heightened by their biological characteristics - long lifespan, low reproductive rate, and low population density - making them particularly vulnerable to environmental shifts.

The ecosystem impacts extend beyond individual species effects. Ocean acidity changes alter marine chemistry, while temperature shifts affect species distribution patterns and migration routes. Current evidence shows blue whales moving from tropical and sub-tropical areas in winter to higher latitudes in summer, suggesting temperature-driven distribution patterns that could be disrupted by climate change.

Marine ecosystems face compound pressures where climate change interacts with other anthropogenic stressors including pollution, underwater noise, and shipping activity. For cetaceans, climate change represents one of several key anthropogenic pressures alongside ship strikes, underwater noise, fishing-related resource depletion, and entanglement.

The assessment reveals critical knowledge gaps in understanding climate change impacts on marine ecosystems. Quantitative data on ecosystem responses remains limited, and the full scope of climate change effects on marine biodiversity requires further research to develop comprehensive management strategies.",4,"The report identifies significant knowledge gaps regarding climate change impacts on blue whales in the Northeast Atlantic. Potential climate change impacts on the marine ecosystem are still poorly understood. Specifically, changes in ocean acidity, water temperature and currents could lead to a reduction in prey availability for blue whales, though the full extent of these impacts remains unquantified.

The assessment recognizes climate change as a key anthropogenic pressure affecting blue whales, including its indirect consequences such as changes in marine ecosystem conditions. However, the report lacks comprehensive data on how these climate-driven changes will specifically impact blue whale populations, feeding patterns, or distribution.

Additional critical knowledge gaps compound the climate change uncertainty. There is no current assessment of blue whale population size in the Northeast Atlantic, making it impossible to establish baseline conditions against which climate impacts could be measured. Data on migration routes and exchange between the Northwest and Northeast Atlantic populations remain poor, limiting understanding of how climate-driven changes in ocean conditions might affect whale movement patterns and habitat use.

The report also identifies insufficient information on how multiple human activities, including shipping, noise production, entanglement, and contaminants, interact with climate pressures to impact the species. This represents a significant gap in understanding cumulative effects.

While actions related to climate change and pollution might benefit blue whales, the overview assessment of implementation reporting was not available at the time of publication, creating an additional information gap regarding the effectiveness of current conservation measures addressing climate-related threats.",4,"Based on the OSPAR report on blue whales, climate change is identified as a key anthropogenic pressure affecting the species, but the understanding remains severely limited. Potential climate change impacts on the marine ecosystem are still poorly understood, with specific concerns that changes in ocean acidity, water temperature, and currents could lead to a reduction in prey availability for blue whales.

The report identifies climate change as having indirect consequences, particularly changes in feeding conditions that could affect blue whale distribution patterns. Given that blue whales are long-lived cetaceans with low reproductive rates and low population density, they are particularly sensitive to environmental changes, making climate impacts potentially significant for population recovery.

Regarding recommendations, the report indicates that actions related to climate change might benefit the species, though specific measures are not detailed in the provided context. The assessment acknowledges that implementation reporting against OSPAR actions was not available at the time of publication, with future status assessments planned to incorporate this information.

Critical research gaps are identified that require further investigation. There is insufficient information on how climate change impacts interact with other human activities affecting blue whales. The report emphasizes the need for better understanding of migration routes and population exchanges between the Northwest and Northeast Atlantic, as climate-driven changes in prey distribution could alter these patterns. Additionally, there is no current assessment of blue whale population size in the Northeast Atlantic, which is essential for understanding climate change vulnerability and monitoring population responses to changing environmental conditions.",4,"Ocean acidification is identified as one component of climate change impacts on marine ecosystems that could affect blue whales, though understanding remains limited. Changes in ocean acidity, along with water temperature and currents, could lead to a reduction in prey species that blue whales depend on. However, potential climate change impacts on the marine ecosystem, including ocean acidification effects, are still poorly understood.

The assessment indicates that ocean acidification poses an indirect threat to blue whales through its effects on the marine food web rather than direct physiological impacts. Since blue whales feed at a low trophic level, primarily on krill and small schooling fish, changes in ocean chemistry that affect these prey species could significantly impact whale populations through reduced food availability.

Climate change, including ocean acidification, is listed among the key anthropogenic pressures affecting blue whales in the OSPAR Maritime Area, alongside ship strikes, underwater noise, fishing-related resource depletion, and entanglement risks. The report notes that actions related to climate change might benefit the species, though specific measures addressing ocean acidification are not detailed.

The assessment reveals a significant knowledge gap regarding how climate change impacts, including ocean acidification, are affecting blue whale populations. There is insufficient current data to quantify the scale of these impacts or to predict future consequences for the species' recovery in the Northeast Atlantic. This represents a critical area requiring further research to understand the full implications of changing ocean chemistry on blue whale conservation and ecosystem health.",4,"Based on the provided context, the specific impacts of ocean acidification on species, habitats and ecosystems are not comprehensively addressed. The context focuses primarily on blue whale populations in the Northeast Atlantic and only briefly mentions ocean acidification.

The limited information available indicates that changes in ocean acidity, combined with water temperature and current changes, could lead to a reduction in prey species. This impact is specifically mentioned in relation to blue whales, where potential climate change impacts on the marine ecosystem are described as still poorly understood.

The context reveals that blue whales feed at low trophic levels, which may afford them some protection from certain environmental impacts, though this is discussed primarily in relation to pollution rather than acidification specifically. Blue whales are considered particularly vulnerable due to their long lifespan, low reproductive rate, and low population density.

However, the assessment explicitly states that potential climate change impacts on marine ecosystems, including those from ocean acidification, remain poorly understood. The document identifies significant knowledge gaps regarding how environmental changes affect marine species and ecosystems.

The provided context is primarily a species-specific assessment for blue whales rather than a comprehensive analysis of ocean acidification impacts across marine ecosystems. It does not contain detailed information about acidification effects on habitats, ecosystem-wide impacts, or impacts on other species groups. The assessment acknowledges that current understanding of these climate-related impacts is insufficient, indicating a need for further research to fully characterize how ocean acidification affects marine species, habitats, and broader ecosystem functions.",2,5,0,5
All other assessments,Bowhead whale,No medata/ pdf,Bowhead whale.pdf,"Climate change represents the primary contemporary threat to Bowhead whales in the OSPAR Maritime Area, having replaced whaling as the main threat. The species is particularly vulnerable due to its complete dependence on sea-ice habitats and its biological characteristics as a long-lived, small stock with slow reproductive cycles.

Direct climate impacts include loss of sea-ice habitats and loss of key Arctic prey species. The species' range will likely shift northward in coming decades due to melting sea-ice, though waters over the deep Arctic basin are unlikely to sustain recovery. More migration between whale stocks may occur as sea-ice melts.

Indirect consequences of dwindling sea-ice create cascading effects: changes in feeding conditions, increased occurrence of predators like killer whales, and dramatically expanded human activities including fishing, tourism, oil and gas exploration, shipping with new Arctic routes opening, and associated pollution and oil spill risks. These activities bring additional threats of underwater noise from military sonar and seismic surveys, entanglement in fishing gear, and ship strikes.

Bowhead whales are especially vulnerable to increasing temperatures due to their longevity and thick blubber layer, making them susceptible to pollutant accumulation. The northward shift of boreal cetacean species increases disease emergence risks.

IPCC reports confirm severe ongoing decline in Arctic sea-ice quantity and quality, with documented severe impacts on bowhead prey species and predator distributions. However, consequences of melting sea ice and increased human activities remain partly speculative, requiring further research on climate change impacts and comprehensive Arctic fauna surveys.",4,"Climate change represents the primary threat to Bowhead whales in the OSPAR Maritime Area, having replaced historical whaling as the main danger. The Spitsbergen population shows no signs of recovery, with climate change complications compounding the species' naturally slow reproductive cycle and extreme longevity.

Direct climate impacts include habitat loss through sea-ice reduction, as Bowhead whales depend heavily on sea-ice areas. Arctic sea-ice decline severely affects bowhead prey species and increases predator occurrence, particularly killer whales. The species faces vulnerability to increasing temperatures due to its longevity and blubber thickness.

Indirect climate consequences prove equally significant. Dwindling sea-ice changes feeding conditions and enables increased human activities throughout the species' range, including fishing, tourism, oil and gas exploration, and shipping. New Arctic shipping routes are emerging as ice melts, creating additional pressures. These activities bring heightened risks of pollution, oil spills, underwater noise from military sonar and seismic surveys, entanglement in fishing gear, and ship strikes.

Climate change may alter migration patterns between whale stocks as sea-ice melts. Northward range shifts are likely in coming decades, though waters over the deep Arctic basin are unlikely to sustain bowhead recovery once ice retreats that far.

The species' northern shift coincides with boreal cetacean species moving northward, potentially introducing new diseases. Climate warming also increases human presence in Arctic regions, compounding existing pressures.

Current knowledge gaps exist regarding melting sea-ice consequences and increased human activities, which remain partly speculative, highlighting the need for comprehensive climate impact studies and large-scale Arctic fauna surveys.",5,"Climate change severely impacts Arctic marine species, habitats, and ecosystems through interconnected direct and indirect mechanisms. Dwindling sea-ice in the Arctic causes habitat loss for ice-dependent species like Bowhead whales, which depend heavily on sea-ice areas. This habitat degradation has severe impacts on prey species composition and availability, fundamentally altering feeding conditions for marine mammals.

Climate change increases predator occurrence, with killer whales appearing in previously ice-covered areas as warming occurs. The loss of key Arctic prey species disrupts established food webs and trophic relationships. Rising temperatures make long-lived species with thick blubber layers particularly vulnerable to thermal stress and pollutant accumulation.

Habitat range shifts occur as species attempt to track suitable conditions northward, but once ice retreats over the deep Arctic basin, these waters become unsuitable for recovery of many species. Increased migration between previously separated populations may occur with melting sea-ice, potentially altering genetic structure and population dynamics.

Climate change enables the northern shift of boreal cetacean species into Arctic waters, leading to emergence of new diseases in native Arctic fauna. The warming also facilitates increased human activities including fishing, tourism, oil and gas exploration, shipping through new Arctic routes, and associated pollution risks.

The vulnerability of Arctic ecosystems is compounded by species characteristics including extreme longevity, slow reproductive cycles, and small population sizes. Consequences of melting sea ice and increased human activities remain partly speculative, indicating significant knowledge gaps in understanding the full scope of climate impacts on Arctic marine ecosystems.",4,"The OSPAR report identifies several critical knowledge gaps specifically related to climate change impacts on Bowhead whales. There is a general lack of information about the Bowhead whale stock and its relationship to other stocks. Consequences of melting sea ice and increased human activities remain partly speculative, requiring further investigation.

The report emphasizes that studies on climate change and its consequences are important priorities, particularly research examining the consequences of an increased human presence in the Arctic. Large-scale surveys to assess the condition of and threats to Arctic fauna, including Bowhead whales, are identified as essential knowledge gaps that need addressing.

These gaps are particularly significant given that climate change represents the main current threat to the species. The Spitsbergen population shows no clear signs of recovery, with threats complicated by climate change's direct impact on reducing suitable habitat and indirect consequences such as increased human activities. Dwindling sea-ice in the Arctic is likely to have severe impacts on bowhead prey species, predator occurrence (killer whales), and the extent of human activities including fishing, oil and gas exploration, tourism, and shipping through emerging new shipping routes.

The species faces direct threats from loss of sea-ice habitats and key Arctic prey species, while indirect effects include changes in feeding conditions, increased predation risk, and expanded human activities in their distribution area. Given the species' extreme sensitivity to climate change due to its long lifespan, small stock size, and slow reproductive cycle, addressing these knowledge gaps is crucial for effective conservation planning.",5,"The OSPAR report specifically recommends that studies on climate change and its consequences are important, including research on the consequences of increased human presence in the Arctic. Large-scale surveys to assess the condition of and threats to Arctic fauna, such as Bowhead whales, are also identified as necessary.

The consequences of melting sea ice and increased human activities remain partly speculative, indicating substantial uncertainty requiring research attention.

The report documents extensive climate change impacts that need continued study. Dwindling sea-ice has severe impacts on bowhead prey species, predator occurrence (killer whales), and the extent of human activities including fishing, oil and gas exploration, tourism, and shipping with emerging new Arctic shipping routes. Northward range shifts are likely in coming decades, though waters over the deep Arctic basin are unlikely to sustain bowhead recovery once ice moves there.

Climate change represents the primary current threat through both direct and indirect effects. Direct impacts include habitat loss from sea ice reductions and loss of key Arctic prey species. Indirect consequences encompass changes in feeding conditions, increased predation risk, and escalating human activities including fishing, tourism, oil and gas exploration, pollution, and new shipping routes crossing the Arctic.

The species' vulnerability is compounded by its extremely long lifespan, slow reproductive cycle, and small population size, making recovery particularly challenging under changing climate conditions. Actions related to climate change and pollution are identified as potentially beneficial for the species.",4,"The provided context does not contain any information about ocean acidification. This OSPAR report focuses exclusively on the status assessment of Bowhead whales in the Spitsbergen stock within OSPAR Region I (Greenland, Iceland, Norway).

The report extensively covers climate change impacts on Bowhead whales, including habitat loss from dwindling sea ice, changes in feeding conditions, increased predator occurrence (killer whales), and rising human activities in Arctic waters. However, ocean acidification - which refers to the chemical changes in seawater due to increased atmospheric CO2 absorption - is not mentioned anywhere in the document.

The climate-related threats identified focus on physical habitat changes: sea ice reductions directly eliminate critical habitat areas that Bowhead whales depend upon, while indirect consequences include altered prey species distribution and abundance, increased shipping routes, expanded oil and gas exploration, and greater tourism activities. The report references IPCC findings regarding sea ice decline impacts but does not address ocean chemistry changes.

Given that ocean acidification can affect marine food webs and prey species that whales depend upon, its absence from this assessment represents a knowledge gap, though the report does acknowledge that ""consequences of melting sea ice and increased human activities remain partly speculative"" and calls for further studies on climate change consequences for Arctic fauna. The focus remains on sea ice habitat loss and associated ecosystem changes rather than ocean chemistry alterations.",1,"The provided context does not address ocean acidification impacts on species, habitats and ecosystems. The context exclusively focuses on Bowhead whale populations and the effects of climate change through sea-ice loss, not ocean acidification.

The context details how climate change affects Arctic marine ecosystems through sea-ice reduction. Dwindling sea-ice severely impacts bowhead prey species and increases predator occurrence, particularly killer whales. The habitat decline affects feeding conditions for Bowhead whales, which depend heavily on sea-ice areas. Climate change causes direct habitat loss as suitable sea-ice environments disappear, with species range likely shifting northward, though deep Arctic basin waters cannot sustain bowhead recovery.

The Spitsbergen Bowhead whale stock, numbering only 102-343 individuals, shows no signs of recovery despite recent sightings of 80-100 individuals. This endangered population faces compound threats from extremely low numbers, slow reproduction, and accelerating habitat loss. Climate-driven changes increase human activities including fishing, tourism, oil and gas exploration, and new shipping routes, creating additional pressures through underwater noise, entanglement risks, and ship strikes.

Ecosystem-level impacts include altered predator-prey relationships as ice-dependent species lose habitat while temperate species expand northward. The loss of key Arctic prey species affects the entire food web structure.

However, the context contains no information about ocean pH changes, carbonate saturation, calcification impacts, or other ocean acidification effects on marine organisms. The consequences of melting sea ice and increased human activities remain partly speculative according to the assessment, with knowledge gaps acknowledged regarding comprehensive ecosystem impacts.",1,7,0,7

Changes in relation to natural variability are not well investigated, specifically distribution of habitats over space and time, environmental drivers of variability, and the roles that ocean physics and dynamics have in structuring carbonate mounds and the processes that support them. Such studies are required to increase the evidence base for future assessments.

The assessment lacks sufficient data accessibility to confidently evaluate climate pressures across the entire region.

**Climate Change Impacts Identified:**
Climate change threatens significant shifts in biological communities on carbonate mounds through altered hydrodynamic regimes, redistribution of primary productivity, reduced organic matter availability to the seafloor, and ocean acidification. Under RCP4.5 scenarios, waters surrounding Hatton and Porcupine Banks will approach aragonite undersaturation by 2100. All carbonate mounds in the Wider Atlantic (Region V) are likely impacted by climate change by 2100. Carbonate mound structure and functioning are highly sensitive and likely to deteriorate due to climate-induced changes in primary production, local hydrodynamics, organic matter flux and ocean acidification.

**Critical Research Gaps:**
Climate change and ocean acidification impacts on carbonate mounds remain unknown since the last assessment and may not have occurred yet or been measured in situ. Changes in relation to natural variability - including distribution of habitats over space and time, environmental drivers of variability, and roles of ocean physics and dynamics in structuring carbonate mounds - are not well investigated and such studies are required to increase the evidence base for future assessments.

**Research Recommendations:**
The assessment suffered from insufficient direct data-driven evidence, particularly for condition monitoring. A coordinated monitoring programme across all deep-sea threatened habitats could solve many data deficiencies. Enhanced predictive modelling approaches are improving in accuracy for scaled assessments. The timescales for climate-induced changes require measurement capabilities to detect impacts that may already be occurring.",5,"Ocean acidification poses significant threats to carbonate mounds in the OSPAR Maritime Area, particularly in Region V (Wider Atlantic). ICES (2014) predicted that under RCP4.5 climate scenario, waters surrounding Hatton and Porcupine Banks will be approaching aragonite undersaturation by 2100. This is critical because carbonate mounds are composed of calcium carbonate structures that are vulnerable to acidification.

Climate change and ocean acidification threaten to induce significant shifts in biological communities on carbonate mounds and impact processes that support these features through altered hydrodynamic regimes, re-distribution of primary productivity, availability of organic matter to the seafloor, and direct acidification effects. Expert judgement concluded that carbonate mound structure and functioning, and thus habitat quality, are highly sensitive and likely to deteriorate in future due to climate-induced changes including ocean acidification.

Short-term exposure to decreased pH can impact cold-water corals that inhabit these mounds, and these pressures are likely to increase over the next six to twelve years. However, climate change and ocean acidification impacts on carbonate mounds remain unknown even since the last assessment and may not have either occurred yet or have not been measured in situ. This represents a significant knowledge gap, as actual impacts cannot yet be evidenced directly despite expert predictions of declining future prospects.

This OSPAR report focuses exclusively on the status assessment of the common skate complex (Dipturus batis and Dipturus intermedius) and addresses their conservation status, population trends, distribution, and threats.

The report discusses the species being critically endangered, with populations remaining depleted in the North Sea since 2008 and status unknown in the Celtic Seas. Fishing pressure is identified as the most important threat, leading to EU prohibitions on landing these species since 2009. While catch rates have increased in scientific surveys since the prohibition, both species remain infrequently recorded or absent from former parts of their geographic range.

The main pressures examined are excessive mortality from fishing, habitat damage, and prey availability issues. Knowledge gaps include the need for information on essential habitats, nursery grounds, discard survival rates, and the efficacy of current protective measures.

No climate-related factors, environmental changes, temperature effects, ocean acidification, or other climate change impacts on these skate species are mentioned or assessed in this document. The analysis is entirely focused on fisheries impacts and conservation measures rather than climate-related threats or changes.",1,"The provided context does not contain any information about threats or pressures related to climate change for the common skate complex. The document focuses entirely on a different set of pressures and threats.

The assessment identifies fishing pressure as the most important threat to both common skate species populations. Excessive mortality from fishing activities represents the primary pressure, with both species being bycaught in bottom trawl and set net fisheries despite landing prohibitions since 2009. Habitat damage is listed as another key pressure category, though specific details about habitat impacts are not elaborated. The impacts of deep-water and recreational fisheries have not been evaluated.

The document notes that common skate complex species predate on a wide variety of demersal fish and crustaceans, suggesting prey availability may not be limiting populations. However, discard survival rates have not been quantified, and there has been an increase in reported landings of long-nosed skate since the prohibition on landing common skate complex, which may reflect misreporting.

Both species remain critically endangered in European waters and are still infrequently recorded or absent from former parts of their geographic range, despite some positive signs including increasing catch rates in scientific trawl surveys since the fishing prohibition was implemented.

**Key Recommendations:**

Levin (2021) recommends distributed observations of climate effects in deep-sea ecosystems, specifically monitoring both environmental changes and biological responses. The report emphasizes that repeated monitoring of coral gardens in protected areas would better inform future habitat prospects. Longer time frames of data collection are required to assess drivers of change in deep-sea habitats due to their expected slow response to environmental changes.

**Areas Requiring Further Investigation:**

Multiple critical research gaps exist. Current understanding of climate change effects on deep-sea ecosystems remains limited. The immediate and current impacts of ocean acidification on coral gardens are difficult to quantify, and data paucity prevents conclusions about whether ocean acidification threats are changing on short time scales. Predictions inadequately account for the increased vulnerability of early life stages to ocean acidification.

**Specific Climate Impacts Identified:**

Deep-sea corals with aragonite skeletons face particular vulnerability to ocean acidification, with impacts predicted by century's end. Under RCP4.5, waters around the Reykjanes Ridge, southern Iceland shelf, and edges of Hatton and Porcupine Banks will approach aragonite undersaturation by 2100.

Deep-sea sponge habitats occur primarily at bathyal depths where the highest climate velocity is expected under various climate change scenarios. These ecosystems function as biodiversity hotspots and nursery grounds for fish species, making their degradation particularly significant for broader marine ecosystems.

However, contemporary and immediate future climate impacts remain difficult to quantify due to limited direct evidence and data gaps.

Major knowledge gaps exist regarding fundamental life history characteristics and physiological data across climate-related variables. Specifically, knowledge is lacking on the nature, behavior and distribution of deep-sea sponge larvae and how changes in ocean circulation affect larval distribution and connectivity among populations. Information on genetic connectivity between sponge grounds is missing, along with critical population dynamics including longevity, growth rates, fecundity and reproductive patterns that are fundamental to modeling and predicting climate effects.

Models predict significant pH shifts in the bathyal zone by 2100 under RCP8.5 climate scenarios, with the northernmost regions of the North Atlantic expected to experience the greatest impacts under worst-case predictions.

Lower pH levels will drastically reduce suitable habitat for ecosystem-engineer species, leading to population density declines, biodiversity loss, and reduced biogeographic distribution that may compromise large-scale connectivity and long-term survival. These impacts will be particularly severe because sponge aggregations primarily occur at bathyal depths where the highest climate velocity is projected under various climate change scenarios.

All other assessments,European or Common sturgeon,No medata/ pdf,European or Common sturgeon.pdf,"Climate change poses significant potential threats to European sturgeon reproduction and survival. Climate change has the potential to adversely affect the reproduction and early life phases of the species through three primary mechanisms: altered river discharge providing suboptimal attraction flow for spawning migration, untimely cues for spawning caused by asynchronous temperature and discharge development, and elevated summer temperatures that exceed the temperature tolerance of the species.

These climate-related impacts specifically target the most vulnerable life stages of this critically endangered species, potentially disrupting their complex reproductive cycle that depends on precise environmental conditions for successful spawning migration from marine to freshwater environments.

However, significant uncertainty remains regarding climate change impacts on European sturgeon. There is low confidence in threat assessment because understanding of future effects of climate change and development of fisheries are unclear. This represents a critical knowledge gap that limits the ability to predict and prepare for climate-related threats to the species.

The climate change concerns are particularly significant given the species' existing vulnerabilities. European sturgeon are long-lived, late maturing, and relatively slow to reproduce, making them sensitive to adverse conditions with slow recovery times. They are especially vulnerable to physiological stresses during migration between fresh and saline water, precisely when climate-altered conditions could have maximum impact.

Given that only one natural population persists in the Gironde system and current recovery efforts depend on restocking programs, climate change represents an additional pressure on an already critically endangered species with extremely limited reproductive capacity.",4,"Climate change poses significant threats to the European sturgeon through multiple pathways affecting reproduction and early life phases. Altered river discharge creates suboptimal attraction flows for spawning migration, while asynchronous temperature and discharge development provides untimely cues for spawning. Elevated summer temperatures exceed the temperature tolerance of the species, directly threatening survival during critical life stages.

These climate-related pressures compound existing threats from habitat alteration, bycatch, and coastal infrastructure developments that cause loss of productive feeding habitats and migration obstruction. The species requires stable bottom sediments and specific hydrodynamic conditions to support benthic invertebrates that form its food base, conditions that climate change disrupts.

The assessment reveals low confidence in threat evaluation specifically because understanding of future climate change effects remains unclear. This uncertainty hampers comprehensive risk assessment for a species already critically endangered, with only one remaining population in the Gironde system. The European sturgeon's life history characteristics - being long-lived, late-maturing, and slow to reproduce - make it particularly vulnerable to climate stresses with slow recovery potential.

Knowledge gaps persist regarding how climate factors influence mortality rates and interact with other pressures. The species' vulnerability during migration between fresh and saline waters may be exacerbated by changing temperature and flow regimes. Identification of habitat requirements for reproduction and early life phases in changing climatic conditions remains incomplete, limiting effective conservation planning for aggregation areas where climate impacts may be most severe.",5,"Climate change adversely affects the European sturgeon's reproduction and early life phases through multiple mechanisms. Altered river discharge provides suboptimal attraction flows for spawning migration, while asynchronous temperature and discharge development creates untimely spawning cues. Elevated summer temperatures exceed the species' temperature tolerance thresholds.

The species exhibits particular vulnerability due to its life history characteristics - it is long-lived, late-maturing, and reproduces relatively slowly, resulting in slow recovery times when populations face impacts. European sturgeon experiences physiological stress during migration between fresh and saline waters, making it especially susceptible during these transitions.

Climate change compounds existing threats to this critically endangered species. The European sturgeon was once widely distributed from the Barents Sea to the Black Sea but became extinct in numerous former spawning rivers by 2003, with only one population remaining in Europe centered on the River Gironde in France. Current marine range extends from northern Spain to the Kattegat and around the British Isles, with notable increases in distribution due to restocking programs in the Gironde and Elbe river systems.

Essential habitat requirements include stable bottom sediments and hydrodynamic conditions that support benthic invertebrates, which provide the species' food base. Climate-induced changes to these conditions reduce carrying capacity. The species requires specific habitat conditions for reproduction, early life phases, and growth in estuaries and marine areas.

Knowledge gaps exist regarding mortality factors and future climate change effects. Low confidence exists in threat assessments because understanding of future climate change effects remains unclear, highlighting the need for continued research into climate impacts on this globally important species.",4,"The report identifies several critical knowledge gaps related to climate change impacts on European sturgeon populations. The assessment expresses low confidence in threat assessment specifically because understanding of future effects of climate change remains unclear. This uncertainty represents a fundamental gap in predicting long-term species viability.

Climate change threatens reproduction and early life phases through multiple mechanisms: altered river discharge creates suboptimal attraction flows for spawning migration, asynchronous temperature and discharge development provides untimely spawning cues, and elevated summer temperatures exceed the species' temperature tolerance thresholds. These impacts affect the most vulnerable life stages when sturgeon are already physiologically stressed during migration between fresh and saline waters.

Key research gaps require investigation of mortality factors to better understand how different climate impacts affect mortality rates across life stages. Since European sturgeon have characteristics making them particularly vulnerable to environmental changes - being long-lived, late-maturing, and slow to reproduce - climate-induced mortality could significantly impair population recovery potential.

The assessment also identifies insufficient knowledge about habitat requirements for reproduction, early life phases, and development in estuarine and marine areas. Understanding these requirements becomes critical under changing climate conditions, as temperature and discharge alterations may shift suitable habitat availability and timing.

Pollution effects during development are poorly documented, representing another gap particularly relevant under climate change scenarios where warming temperatures may intensify contaminant impacts. The interaction between climate stressors and existing threats like habitat alteration, bycatch mortality, and pollution creates compounding effects that remain inadequately understood for this critically endangered species.",5,"Climate change poses significant threats to European sturgeon reproduction and early life phases through three primary mechanisms: altered river discharge that provides suboptimal attraction flow for spawning migration, untimely spawning cues caused by asynchronous temperature and discharge development, and elevated summer temperatures that exceed the species' temperature tolerance.

The report identifies critical research gaps requiring investigation. Understanding of future climate change effects remains unclear, contributing to low confidence in threat assessments despite high confidence in status assessments based on quantitative data. Factors influencing mortality rates need deeper investigation to better understand the role of different impacts, particularly since fisheries-induced mortality is crucial for population recovery potential.

Several specific research priorities are outlined: more detailed information on fishery impacts is required; identification of habitat requirements for reproduction, early life phases, and development in estuaries and marine areas would help determine aggregation areas where the species faces vulnerability to by-catch, poaching, and pollution; development of a joint database on bycatch data may help identify marine distribution patterns and aggregation areas; pollution effects during development are poorly documented and require investigation; and the role of predation by both indigenous and non-indigenous predators on early age classes needs further investigation to determine impacts throughout the life cycle.

The documented threats include habitat alteration affecting spawning and nursery sites, fisheries-induced mortality through by-catch, coastal infrastructure developments causing loss of productive feeding habitats, dredging and bottom-touching fishing gear that destabilize sediments and reduce benthic invertebrate populations essential for the sturgeon's food base.

Climate change impacts are mentioned but specifically relate to altered river discharge patterns providing suboptimal spawning migration flows, asynchronous temperature and discharge development creating untimely spawning cues, and elevated summer temperatures exceeding the species' temperature tolerance. These climate effects focus on freshwater and estuarine environments rather than marine acidification processes.

The context emphasizes that stability of bottom sediments and maintenance of hydrodynamic conditions supporting benthic invertebrate communities are essential prerequisites for sufficient food availability for European sturgeon.

The report specifically lists ""adverse effects of climate change"" alongside overexploitation of natural beds, introduction of non-native oysters, and specific epidemic outbreaks as the primary drivers of population collapse.

However, the report provides limited detail about the specific mechanisms or extent of climate change impacts on European flat oyster populations. The climate change effects are mentioned as part of a broader threat assessment but are not elaborated upon with specific data, temperature ranges, or detailed impact pathways.

The report indicates that further research is needed on environmental factors influencing oyster settlement, recruitment, and restoration success. Environmental parameters are identified as important factors determining restoration outcomes, but the specific climate-related parameters are not detailed. Additionally, the document notes that comprehensive long-term monitoring is essential to assess habitat quality and oyster bed development over time, which would presumably include tracking climate-related changes.

Natural flat oyster spat production in Europe has decreased by almost 60% over the past ten years, though this decline is attributed to multiple stressors rather than climate change alone. The report emphasizes that successful restoration requires understanding environmental factors influencing reproductive and settlement processes, but does not specify which of these factors are climate-related versus other environmental variables.

Overall, while climate change is clearly recognized as a significant threat contributing to oyster population decline, the report lacks detailed analysis of specific climate impacts, making it difficult to assess the full scope of climate-related effects on this critically important marine species.",2,"Climate change represents one of several major factors driving the decline of wild flat oyster populations to marginal figures across many European areas. The adverse effects of climate change are identified as a key threat alongside overexploitation of natural beds, introduction of non-native oysters, and specific epidemic outbreaks.

Beyond climate change's direct impacts, the report identifies multiple interconnected pressures threatening oyster populations. Microplastics impact the health and biological functioning of European flat oysters and associated macrofauna. Alien species create negative effects through increased competition, predation, and disease transfer. Natural predators including Sea Bream, Starfish, Crustaceans, and Oyster driller pose additional threats. Habitat destruction and oyster bed loss from bottom fishing remain relevant in some areas.

The European flat oyster shows high sensitivity to substrate loss, smothering, silt deposition, synthetic compound contamination, introduction of microbial pathogens/parasites, introduction of non-native species, and direct extraction. Natural flat oyster spat production in Europe has decreased almost 60% over the past ten years. Diseases, mainly bonamiosis and marteiliosis, are found in oyster populations along the European Atlantic coast in the North Sea and Mediterranean basin.

Key pressures including fisheries, habitat damage, introduction and further distribution of non-indigenous species, and diseases/pathogens continue posing significant threats to oyster beds.

However, significant knowledge gaps exist specifically regarding climate change impacts on these ecosystems.

The report reveals substantial gaps in understanding climate change effects on oyster populations. Information on environmental factors influencing oyster settlement and recruitment processes is lacking, despite these being critical for population recovery. Research gaps exist regarding environmental parameters that determine the success of restoration measures, which is particularly important given extensive restoration efforts across all OSPAR regions.

Monitoring limitations compound these knowledge gaps. Native oyster bed monitoring is insufficient across many areas, and some climate-related impacts are hardly investigated or not sufficiently monitored, resulting in lacking data for certain regions. This creates moderate rather than high confidence in threat assessments.

The gaps extend to fundamental ecological questions about how environmental changes affect oyster interactions with predators and competitors. Understanding of factors determining successful settlement and recruitment of wild populations, including critical environmental thresholds and settlement substrate characteristics, remains inadequate.

Additionally, comprehensive long-term monitoring systems are needed to assess how climate change affects habitat quality and oyster bed development over time, but these monitoring frameworks are currently insufficient.

Successful management includes fisheries regulation through seasonal restrictions, quotas, and minimum landing sizes, limitation of non-indigenous species propagation, pathogen transmission reduction, and habitat preservation measures including suitable substrate introduction and marine protected area establishment in severely damaged regions.

The document identifies substantial knowledge gaps requiring investigation. Many fundamental ecological questions need comprehensive research, particularly interactions between oysters and predators/competitors. Critical research needs include factors and requirements for successful settlement and recruitment of wild populations, including critical weight and settlement substratum characteristics, plus environmental factors influencing these processes.

Further investigations are specifically needed in marine conservation to understand environmental parameters and biological interactions determining restoration measure success.

Sea level rise will substantially increase demand for replenishment sand and fill sand, with projections suggesting sand demand for coastal maintenance could reach 85 million m³ per year, though more recent estimates indicate 10-37 million m³ per year after 2035, depending on sea level rise rates of 2-8 mm annually.

Future aggregate extraction trends will be directly influenced by coastal defense work requirements responding to climate-driven sea level rise. The Netherlands, where sand extraction serves national interests including flood risk management, exemplifies this pressure through beach nourishment and coastal reinforcement activities.

The transition to renewable energy, driven partly by climate mitigation efforts, creates additional resource pressures. Global demand for critical materials including copper, cobalt, nickel, lithium, silver, rare earth elements and critical metals is expected to double by 2050-2060, with renewable energy transition and associated energy storage requirements being key demand drivers.

These climate-related pressures compound existing environmental impacts from marine sediment extraction, which include loss of materials, impacts on benthic fauna, sand coverage on surrounding seabeds, suspended matter in water, and noise effects. Recovery times vary significantly, with restoration in gravel habitats taking ten years or more, while dynamic sandy habitats recover faster. Physical changes like furrows can persist from months in mobile sand areas to decades in stable sediments.

Knowledge gaps remain regarding long-term seabed recovery and impacts on fish and small benthic fauna, requiring continued research to address climate-driven extraction pressures while protecting marine ecosystems.",4,"Based on the provided context, this OSPAR report does not address how climate change impacts species, habitats and ecosystems. The context focuses exclusively on the environmental impacts of marine sediment extraction (sand and gravel mining) and deep sea mining activities in the OSPAR Maritime Area.

The only climate change reference in the context relates to sea-level rise driving increased demand for sand extraction. Sea-level rise anticipated due to climate change will increase demand for replenishment sand and fill sand, with potential demand for coastal maintenance growing to 10-37 million m³ per year after 2035, depending on sea level rise of 2-8 mm per year. This increased extraction activity will indirectly affect marine ecosystems through the extraction impacts described.

The context does document extensive impacts on marine species, habitats and ecosystems, but these result from human extraction activities rather than climate change. Sand and gravel extraction causes loss of materials, impacts on benthic fauna (few survive the extraction process), sand coverage on nearby seabeds, suspended matter in water, and noise. Changes in seabed topography persist from months in mobile sand areas to decades in stable sediments. Recovery varies significantly - restoration of species diversity and biomass in gravel habitats requires ten years or more, while dynamic sandy habitats recover faster. Deep sea mining poses additional risks including substrate loss, seabed integrity changes, sediment plumes, increased light and noise levels, and release of toxic metals.

The context contains no direct information about climate change impacts on marine species, habitats, or ecosystems beyond the indirect effects of increased extraction demand.",1,"The report identifies several specific knowledge gaps related to climate change and marine resource extraction. Variable quality of assessments makes it difficult to determine whether current regulations have effectively improved protection of benthic ecosystems, requiring continued efforts to address gaps in knowledge of issues such as impacts on fish and small benthic fauna and long-term recovery of the seabed.

For deep sea mining, much uncertainty remains about the nature of extraction activities in the north-east Atlantic in terms of geography, water depth, potential pressures and sensitivity of habitats. Understanding of the extent and nature of impacts is uncertain, particularly given the rapid rate of change in technical approaches and mitigation techniques still in development. Further research and knowledge on the deep sea environment and its resilience are required to move from exploration to exploitation.

Climate change creates specific knowledge gaps regarding future demand scenarios. Sea-level rise driven by climate change will affect the need for coastal defence works and influence future aggregate extraction trends. Demand for sand for coastal maintenance could potentially grow to 85 million cubic meters per year, though more recent expectations are 10-37 million cubic meters per year after 2035, depending on sea level rise of 2-8 mm per year. However, the relationship between these climate-driven demands and marine aggregate extraction remains complex and incompletely understood.

The assessment also notes complexities in developing cumulative impact assessment methods, including challenges in assessing trends over time and space, and whether habitat changes from extraction can be considered positive in some circumstances. These methodological gaps limit the ability to fully assess climate-related impacts on marine extraction activities.",4,"The report identifies climate change as a significant driver affecting marine resource extraction but contains limited specific recommendations addressing climate change directly.

Sea level rise driven by climate change will substantially increase demand for coastal defence materials. In the Netherlands, demand for sand for coastal maintenance could reach 85 million cubic meters annually, though recent projections estimate 10-37 million cubic meters per year after 2035, depending on sea level rise rates of 2-8 millimeters annually. This represents a major increase from current extraction levels.

The transition to renewable energy, associated with increased energy storage requirements, is driving up demand for critical metals including copper, cobalt, nickel, lithium, silver, and rare earth elements. Global demand for these resources is anticipated to double by 2050-2060, potentially necessitating deep sea mining operations.

Several areas requiring further investigation are identified. For deep sea mining, further research and knowledge on deep sea environment resilience are required before moving from exploration to exploitation. Understanding of potential environmental impacts remains uncertain given rapidly changing technical approaches and mitigation techniques still in development. There is substantial uncertainty about the nature of extraction activities in the north-east Atlantic regarding geography, water depth, potential pressures and habitat sensitivity.

For existing marine aggregate extraction, knowledge gaps persist regarding impacts on fish and small benthic fauna, long-term seabed recovery processes, and assessment of trends over time and space. The report recommends incorporating valuation of change over time within cumulative assessment frameworks. Resource mapping and sustainability evaluations are still needed in several countries, including Norway's continental shelf areas and fjords.",4,"Based on the provided context, ocean acidification is not addressed in this OSPAR report. The document focuses exclusively on the extraction of non-living marine resources (sand, gravel, and deep-sea minerals) within the OSPAR Maritime Area and the environmental impacts of these extraction activities.

The report covers impacts such as loss of substrate materials, effects on benthic fauna, sand coverage on seabeds, suspended matter in water, noise pollution, and release of sediment-bound toxic metals into the water column from extraction activities. It discusses recovery times for different habitat types, with restoration of species diversity and biomass in gravel habitats taking ten years or more, while dynamic sandy habitats recover faster.

The only climate-related mention is the need for coastal defence works in response to sea level rise driven by climate change, which affects demand for marine aggregates. However, ocean acidification - the process by which ocean pH decreases due to absorption of atmospheric carbon dioxide - is not discussed, analyzed, or mentioned anywhere in this technical report on marine resource extraction.

The context provided is therefore not relevant to answering questions about ocean acidification, as this OSPAR report deals with entirely different marine environmental issues related to physical extraction activities rather than chemical changes in seawater.",1,"The provided context does not address ocean acidification and its impacts on species, habitats, and ecosystems. Instead, the context exclusively discusses the extraction of non-living marine resources (primarily sand, gravel, and deep-sea mining) and their environmental impacts within the OSPAR Maritime Area.

The context focuses on physical extraction activities and their consequences, including impacts on benthic fauna (few of which survive the extraction process), sand coverage on seabeds, suspended matter in water, and noise effects. For sand and gravel extraction, topographical changes can persist from months in highly mobile sand areas to decades in stable sediments. Recovery timescales vary significantly - restoration of species diversity and biomass in gravel habitats requires ten years or more, while dynamic sandy habitats recover faster.

Deep-sea mining impacts include substrate loss, seabed integrity changes, operational suspended sediment and chemical plumes, re-sedimentation, discharge plumes, increased light and noise levels, vibration, and release of sediment-bound or subsurface porewater toxic metals into the water column. Knowledge gaps exist regarding impacts on fish and small benthic fauna, and understanding of extraction impact extent and nature remains uncertain due to rapidly changing technical approaches and developing mitigation techniques.

The context emphasizes that extraction can pose serious threats to biodiversity in gravelly areas and fish species through spawning area loss, though proper site selection and management can minimize impacts. However, none of this information relates to ocean acidification, which involves chemical changes to seawater pH due to carbon dioxide absorption and its subsequent effects on marine organisms and ecosystems.",1,,,

Stock distributions and sizes are changing, potentially affecting assessment of sustainable catch levels and complicating negotiations between coastal states. Climate change has already impacted the distribution and timing of fishing activities and increased bycatch of protected, endangered and threatened species.

The Barents Sea's production potential is expected to increase to 2050, with northward shifts of species such as cod and haddock creating potentially negative risks for associated ecosystems and mixed opportunities for commercial fisheries. In seas west of Scotland, warming will negatively affect cold-water species abundance including cod, but may benefit species like whiting and hake. For the North-East Atlantic overall, changes in stock biomass and feeding distribution are expected to increase complexity in allocations of shared stocks of whiting, mackerel and herring, with risks of overfishing due to unilaterally set quotas.

Primary productivity in the North Sea has declined over the past 25 years, with mackerel distribution shifts causing quota allocation issues and increasing tuna sightings off the British Isles. Primary production and copepod biomass declines consistent with climate change are likely to lead to declines in fisheries yield. Changes in fish populations are already evident in Arctic regions, though uncertainties remain around climate change impacts on regional fishing opportunities.

Climate change, combined with bycatch, has driven abundance declines and spatial range contractions in species like starry ray. The zooplankton Calanus finmarchius is projected to increase substantially, potentially creating new fishery opportunities but also food chain risks including fish larvae bycatch.

Fish population changes are already evident in Arctic regions, with major distributional shifts occurring. Primary productivity in the North Sea has declined over the past 25 years, while mackerel distribution shifts have caused quota allocation issues. Increasing tuna sightings off the British Isles indicate species range expansions.

Projected changes show large-scale redistribution of maximum fisheries catch potential by 2055, with 30-70% increases in high latitude areas like Norway and Greenland's exclusive economic zones, and decreases below 50°N. The Barents Sea's production potential is expected to increase to 2050, with northward shifts of cod and haddock creating potentially negative ecosystem risks.

Primary production and copepod biomass declines consistent with climate change are likely reducing fisheries yields.

Combined with bycatch pressures, climate change has driven abundance declines and spatial contractions in sensitive species like starry ray. North Sea cod stock declines may partially result from warming waters. Climate change affects the distribution and timing of fishing activities and impacts protected species bycatch. Overall, climate change reduces fish stocks' capacity to adapt to environmental changes and creates significant uncertainties for sustainable fisheries management.",5,"Climate change represents a significant uncertainty for fisheries management, creating multiple gaps in knowledge and assessment capabilities. Stock distributions and sizes are changing, which affects the assessment of sustainable catch levels and complicates negotiations between coastal states regarding fishing quotas.

The IPCC has identified uncertainties around climate change impacts on fishing opportunities, particularly in Arctic regions where changes in fish populations are already evident. These uncertainties extend to data gaps, as not all data were provided for German pelagic trawlers in the North Sea/eastern Arctic analysis. Primary production and copepod biomass declines consistent with climate change are likely to lead to declines in fisheries yield.

Assessment frameworks face significant limitations. ICES working groups are still developing frameworks to assess regional-scale impacts, indicating current assessment capabilities are insufficient. The European Commission has noted that assessment of food web status across European seas is affected by lack of consistent approaches, high uncertainty, and lack of data gaps.

Monitoring gaps are evident for bycatch assessment, with ICES advising that better monitoring is needed, including for smaller vessels. Information on the scale and impact of seabird bycatch requires improvement. These monitoring deficiencies are particularly problematic given that climate change has already impacted the distribution and timing of fishing activities, affecting bycatch of protected, endangered and threatened species.

The dynamic nature of marine ecosystems means Maximum Sustainable Yield reference points are only valid in the medium-term and require regular reviews, yet current assessment capabilities appear inadequate to address the pace and complexity of climate-driven changes affecting fish populations, their interactions, and ecosystem dynamics.",5,"Climate change represents a significant uncertainty affecting stock distributions, sizes, and sustainable catch level assessments while complicating negotiations between coastal states.

This OSPAR report focuses exclusively on the status assessment of gulper sharks (Centrophorus granulosus) and addresses only fisheries-related pressures and threats.

The report identifies fishing pressure as the sole threat to gulper sharks, noting that this pressure has declined over the past 15 years due to EU management measures. A zero total allowable catch was adopted in 2010 for deep-water sharks, with limited exceptions for bycatch in black scabbardfish longline fisheries since 2017. Various fishing restrictions have been implemented, including bans on gill nets, entangling nets, and trammel nets at depths greater than 600 meters from 2007, and restrictions on bottom trawling to depths of 800 meters or less after 2016.

The assessment reveals significant data deficiencies regarding gulper shark populations. Stock structure in the North-East Atlantic remains unknown, current population size cannot be evaluated, and recent abundance trends are indeterminate. The species is rarely caught in scientific research surveys, and ICES provides no advice for this species.

Fishing pressure is identified as the only threat to the gulper shark in the OSPAR assessment. While fishing effort has strongly decreased over the past 15 years due to EU management measures, the species remains vulnerable due to bycatch mortality in deep-water fisheries. A zero total allowable catch was adopted in 2010 for deep-water sharks, with limited exceptions for bycatch in longline fisheries targeting black scabbardfish since 2017.

The report notes that gill nets, entangling nets, and trammel nets were banned at depths greater than 600 meters from 2007, and bottom trawling was restricted to depths of 800 meters or less after 2016. However, since gulper sharks commonly inhabit the 300-800 meter depth range, only part of the population may be protected by these measures.

Data limitations significantly hamper assessment capabilities. Abundance and biomass index estimates are lacking, stock structure in the North-East Atlantic is unknown, and discard sampling data are inadequate to estimate commercial fishery catches.

However, subsequent scientific analysis specifically contradicted this hypothesis. Munilla et al (2007) conducted a detailed investigation of the population collapse and found no evidence supporting climate change as a contributing factor.

The study revealed that climatic conditions were actually good during the worst period of the Iberian guillemot decline. Researchers detected no decrease in the availability of pelagic fish, which are the likely prey species for guillemots, suggesting that climate-related changes to the marine food web were not driving the population crash. The analysis concluded that climate change effects on prey availability have not been demonstrated for this species.

Instead, the rapid development of gillnet fisheries emerged as the main factor underpinning the population collapse, with incidental by-catch in fishing nets identified as the primary cause. Oil pollution also contributed significantly to the decline, with large oil spills potentially contributing to the species' extinction as a breeding seabird in the region.

The Iberian guillemot is now considered virtually extinct as a breeding species, with the last breeding event recorded in Portugal in 2002 and in Spain in 2007. While climate change was listed among initial hypotheses for the decline alongside pollution, prey availability changes, and fishing mortality, scientific investigation specifically ruled out climate-related impacts, demonstrating that human activities rather than climatic factors drove this subspecies to near-extinction.",4,"Climate change was initially suggested as one of the main causes for the dramatic 33.3% annual decline of the Iberian guillemot between 1960 and 1974, alongside pollution, changes in prey availability, and incidental by-catch mortality in fishing nets.

The specific study by Munilla et al. (2007) that analyzed the population collapse found no evidence supporting climate change impacts. The authors detected no decrease in the availability of likely prey (pelagic fish), and climatic conditions were actually good during the worst period of the Iberian guillemot decline. The analysis concluded that climate change effects on prey availability have not been demonstrated.

Instead, human activities emerged as the primary drivers of the population crash. The rapid development of gillnet fisheries appears as the main factor underpinning the collapse, while pollution derived from large oil spills could have contributed to the extinction. Oil pollution and incidental by-catch in fishing nets have been identified as the main causes of the population crash, rather than climate-related factors.

The Iberian guillemot breeding population is now probably extinct in the OSPAR Region IV, with the last breeding events recorded in Portugal in 2002 and Spain in 2007. While climate change was initially considered as a potential threat, the available scientific evidence does not support its role in the species' decline, contrasting with the clear evidence for fishing-related mortality and pollution impacts.",4,"Based on the provided context, climate change has been suggested as one of the potential impacts on species, specifically the Iberian guillemot (Uria aalge albionis), though the evidence remains inconclusive.

Climate change was initially proposed as one of four main causes contributing to the dramatic 33.3% annual decline of the Iberian guillemot population between 1960 and 1974, alongside pollution, changes in prey availability, and incidental by-catch mortality in fishing nets. However, subsequent scientific analysis by Munilla et al (2007) found no evidence supporting climate change as a significant factor in this species' collapse.

The researchers did not detect a decrease in the availability of likely prey (pelagic fish) during the decline period. Additionally, climatic conditions were actually good during the worst period of the Iberian guillemot decline. Climate change effects on prey availability have not been demonstrated for this species.

The Iberian guillemot population has suffered catastrophic decline, dropping from approximately 6,000 breeding pairs in Portugal's Berlengas islands in 1939 and 1,500 pairs on Spain's Galician coast during 1940-1960 to virtual extinction. The last breeding event occurred in 2002 with 17 birds, and the last single individual was observed in 2014. The species is now probably extinct as a breeding seabird in the region.

While climate change was initially considered as a potential threat, the available evidence from this single-species case study indicates that other factors, particularly incidental by-catch in fishing nets and oil pollution, were the primary drivers of population decline rather than climate-related impacts.",2,"Regarding climate change, multiple significant gaps exist in understanding its role in the Iberian guillemot's population decline. Climate change effects on prey availability have not been demonstrated, despite being suggested as one of the main causes for the species' dramatic decline. Analysis by Munilla et al (2007) found no decrease in availability of likely prey (pelagic fish), and climatic conditions were actually good during the worst period of the Iberian guillemot decline, indicating that climate change effects on main prey availability could not be demonstrated.

The assessment reveals substantial data gaps that prevent comprehensive climate change analysis. Overall published information about the Iberian guillemot is scarce, with only one scientific paper investigating the causes of population crash. Assessment is based mainly on extrapolation from limited data, with trends being inevitably estimative due to scarcity of censuses available, particularly in Spain. Some ecological parameters are inferred from other populations due to lack of accurate information.

A considerable gap exists when analyzing the trend of the Iberian guillemot in Spain - the scarcity of accurate censuses available and lack of periodicity between them severely limits understanding. Since the species has now disappeared, it is impossible to obtain new information, and any future research must rely on older, scarce data or information from other populations.

The assessment acknowledges that while climate change was suggested as a potential cause for the species' 33.3% annual decline between 1960-1974, no evidence supports climate-related impacts on prey availability. The rapid development of gillnet fisheries and oil pollution appear as the main demonstrated factors in the population crash, while climate change effects remain unproven.",4,"Based on the OSPAR report on the Iberian guillemot, climate change has been identified as one of the suggested main causes for the species' dramatic 33.3% annual decline between 1960 and 1974, alongside pollution, changes in prey availability, and incidental by-catch mortality in fishing nets.

However, the evidence for climate change impacts remains inconclusive and requires further investigation. Climate change effects on prey availability have not been demonstrated. Munilla et al. (2007) analyzed the population collapse and found no decrease in the availability of likely prey (pelagic fish). Furthermore, climatic conditions were actually good during the worst period of the Iberian guillemot decline, and a possible effect of climate change on the availability of main prey species could not be established.

OSPAR Recommendation 2014/2016 addresses the need for further research by calling for the study of key negative impacts on the population, though it specifically emphasizes by-catch in fishing gears and oil spills rather than climate change.

Ocean acidification is simply not covered in this particular OSPAR assessment, which is focused entirely on seabird population dynamics and terrestrial/surface-level marine threats rather than chemical changes in ocean water.",1,"The provided context does not address ocean acidification or its impacts on species, habitats, and ecosystems. Instead, the context consists entirely of information about the Iberian guillemot (Uria aalge albionis), a seabird species that has experienced dramatic population decline in the OSPAR Maritime Area Region IV.

The context documents the guillemot's decline from approximately 6,000 breeding pairs in Portugal's Berlengas islands in 1939 and about 1,500 breeding pairs on Spain's Galician coast during 1940-1960, to virtual extinction as a breeding species by present day. Between 1960 and 1974, the species suffered an annual decline of 33.3%. The breeding population has probably already disappeared and recovery is considered very unlikely.

The documented causes of this decline include pollution, changes in prey availability, incidental by-catch mortality in fishing nets, oil spills, and increased fishing effort. While climate change was suggested as a potential factor, research by Munilla et al (2007) found that climatic conditions were actually favorable during the worst period of decline, and no decrease in prey availability was detected.

The assessment is based mainly on extrapolation from limited data, with overall published information about the species being scarce. Only one scientific paper has investigated the causes of the population crash, and trends remain estimative due to scarcity of census data.

To answer questions about ocean acidification impacts, different source material specifically addressing ocean chemistry changes and their biological effects would be required.",1,5,0,5
All other assessments,Intertidal mudflats,No medata/ pdf,Intertidal mudflats.pdf,"Climate change is identified as one of the key pressures affecting intertidal mudflats in the OSPAR Maritime Area, with multiple documented impacts on these coastal habitats. The primary climate-related impacts include sea level rise and increased storm frequency, which directly affect the sedimentation patterns of mudflats and estuaries. These changes alter exposure time patterns that are critical for mudflat ecology.

Climate change causes coastal squeeze, particularly documented in the UK, where rising sea levels compress intertidal habitats between advancing water and fixed coastal infrastructure. Temperature increases associated with climate change result in changing ecological interactions between species, disrupting established community structures. These temperature shifts facilitate the establishment of invasive species such as the Pacific oyster Magallana gigas, which further alter habitat characteristics.

The condition of intertidal mudflats across the OSPAR area is classified as poor, attributed to multiple anthropogenic pressures including climate change, along with nutrient enrichment, invasive species, and hydrological changes from construction activities. This poor condition persists despite the geographical distribution and extent of mudflats being generally stable in most regions.

While mudflats are naturally resilient and can recover from isolated physical and chemical disturbances, the process becomes irreversible once the habitat disappears entirely. The combination of climate change effects with other human pressures creates cumulative impacts that compromise the ecological functions of these habitats, including their roles as feeding areas for waterfowl, nursery areas for fish, and natural coastal protection systems.",4,"Climate change represents a key pressure threatening intertidal mudflats in the OSPAR Maritime Area, manifesting through multiple interconnected mechanisms. Sea level rise and increased storm frequency directly alter sedimentation patterns of mudflats and estuaries, while causing coastal squeeze effects, particularly documented in the UK, and changes in exposure time of these habitats.

Temperature increases from climate change fundamentally alter ecological interactions between species within mudflat ecosystems. This warming trend facilitates the establishment of invasive species such as the Pacific oyster Magallana gigas, which further disrupts native community structures.

Climate change stands among the primary pressures identified in the QSR 2010, alongside hydrographical changes, hazardous substances, oil pollution, habitat damage, and habitat loss. The condition of intertidal mudflats across the OSPAR area remains poor, with climate change identified as one of the multiple anthropogenic pressures responsible for this deteriorated state, working in combination with nutrient enrichment, invasive species, and hydrological changes.

The physical impacts of climate change on mudflats are particularly concerning given that while these habitats demonstrate natural resilience to isolated physical and chemical disturbances, habitat loss through climate-induced changes can be irreversible. This vulnerability is heightened by mudflats' exposed position between land and sea, making them especially susceptible to climate-driven alterations in coastal dynamics, storm patterns, and temperature regimes that collectively threaten their ecological functions as feeding areas for waterfowl and nursery habitats for fish.",5,"Climate change impacts species, habitats and ecosystems through multiple interconnected mechanisms. Sea level rise and increased storm frequency alter sedimentation patterns of mudflats and estuaries, create coastal squeeze conditions (particularly documented in the UK), and change exposure times for intertidal habitats. Temperature increases fundamentally alter ecological interactions between species, disrupting established community structures and relationships.

These changes facilitate invasive species establishment, specifically documented with Pacific oyster Magallana gigas, which can outcompete native species and alter habitat characteristics. Climate change ranks among the key pressures affecting critical habitats like intertidal mudflats, alongside hydrographical changes, hazardous substances, oil pollution, habitat damage, and habitat loss.

The cascading effects are severe for ecosystem function. Intertidal mudflats, which serve as feeding and resting areas for waterfowl and nursery areas for fish, face degraded conditions throughout the OSPAR area. While geographical distribution remains generally stable in Regions II, III and IV, habitat condition is poor due to climate change combined with nutrient enrichment, invasive species, and hydrological changes from construction activities.

These impacts create irreversible consequences - once habitats disappear, the process cannot be reversed. Climate-driven changes compound other anthropogenic pressures, creating synergistic effects that fundamentally alter community structure and ecosystem services. The temperature increases particularly affect species interactions, potentially disrupting food webs and altering competitive relationships that have evolved over long time periods, leading to permanent ecosystem reorganization.",5,"Climate change represents a significant knowledge gap area in relation to intertidal mudflats. The full extent and loss of habitat over time remains not fully documented for most Contracting Parties, despite improved mapping since QSR 2010. Data on extent, distribution and threats are lacking for numerous areas, limiting comprehensive assessment of climate change impacts.

Specific climate-related gaps include insufficient understanding of how sea level rise and increased storm frequency affect sedimentation patterns in mudflats and estuaries. The phenomenon of coastal squeeze, particularly documented in the UK, requires better quantification. Changes in exposure time due to rising seas need more comprehensive monitoring. Temperature increases are altering ecological interactions between species, but these complex relationships remain poorly understood.

The knowledge gaps are compounded by methodological limitations. Habitat monitoring focuses primarily on extent and distribution rather than condition and threats, creating less certain conclusions about climate impacts. Not all Contracting Parties provided input data, and reasons for this data absence remain unknown. Some areas rely on expert opinion with very limited data, while others have insufficient or no data available.

The QSR 2010 recommendation to harmonise data collection on these habitats has not been fully implemented, making it impossible to determine exact habitat extent and condition changes. No agreed protocols exist for intertidal habitat restoration, limiting adaptive management responses to climate change. The relationship between climate pressures and habitat condition requires better integration with water quality assessments for contaminants and nutrients to develop effective safeguarding measures.",5,"Climate change represents a key pressure affecting intertidal mudflats, causing multiple documented impacts including sea level rise and increased storm frequency that affect sedimentation patterns of mudflats and estuaries. These changes result in coastal squeeze (particularly documented in the UK) and alterations in exposure time. Temperature increases from climate change are changing ecological interactions between species within these habitats.

The condition of intertidal mudflats remains poor across the OSPAR area due to multiple anthropogenic pressures, with climate change identified as one of the primary factors alongside nutrient enrichment, invasive species, and hydrological changes. The status has not improved since the 2009 assessment.

OSPAR collective actions specifically recommend improving the mapping database and sharing knowledge on intertidal mudflats with stakeholders and international authorities. A critical recommendation involves identifying whether further measures to maintain or improve water quality regarding contaminants and nutrients are necessary to safeguard relevant habitats and implementing these measures if required.

Significant knowledge gaps persist from the QSR 2010 assessment, with recommendations to further harmonize data collection on these habitats since determining exact extent, habitat loss, and condition remains problematic. The full extent of habitat loss over time is not fully documented for most Contracting Parties. No agreed protocols exist for intertidal habitat restoration, and artificial mudflats are not considered viable compensation since their functional characteristics would be rapidly lost without regular maintenance. Data sufficiency remains an issue, with extent, distribution, and threat data lacking for numerous areas, limiting comprehensive climate impact assessments.",4,"The provided context does not contain any information about ocean acidification. The OSPAR report focuses exclusively on intertidal mudflats as a habitat, examining their distribution, extent, condition, and various threats affecting them in the OSPAR Maritime Area.

The context covers multiple anthropogenic pressures impacting mudflats, including climate change effects such as sea level rise, increased storm frequency, and temperature increases that alter ecological interactions between species. Other documented threats include nutrient enrichment causing organic enrichment effects, invasive species like Pacific oyster, coastal developments, toxic effects from contaminants, oil pollution, fishing activities, and hydrological changes from construction.

While climate change is identified as a key pressure affecting mudflats through various mechanisms including temperature increases and altered sedimentation patterns, ocean acidification is not mentioned as one of these climate-related impacts. The report's climate change discussion centers on physical changes like sea level rise, storm frequency, temperature effects on species interactions, and coastal squeeze rather than chemical changes to seawater pH.

The assessment identifies multiple knowledge gaps regarding mudflats, including insufficient data on extent, distribution and threats in various areas, but ocean acidification is not discussed as either a known threat or a knowledge gap requiring further research for this habitat type.",1,"The provided context focuses exclusively on intertidal mudflats and does not contain any information about ocean acidification or its impacts on species, habitats, and ecosystems. Ocean acidification is not mentioned anywhere in the text.

The context documents detail threats to intertidal mudflats from climate change effects including sea level rise, increased storm frequency affecting sedimentation patterns, temperature increases causing changing ecological interactions between species, and coastal squeeze. Additional pressures include coastal development causing physical habitat removal and food web effects, toxic effects from effluent discharges containing contaminants, organic enrichment leading to opportunistic green macroalgae coverage forming anoxic green tide mats, oil spills causing pollution and infauna death, fishing activities impacting community structure, and invasive species such as Pacific oyster.

The condition of intertidal mudflats remains poor due to multiple anthropogenic pressures including climate change, nutrient enrichment, invasive species, and hydrological changes. Habitat reduction has occurred mainly due to land claim, infrastructure development, and spread of cordgrass Spartina anglica. While mudflats are naturally resilient to isolated physical and chemical disturbances except oil pollution, habitat loss is irreversible once it occurs.

Mudflats provide feeding and resting areas for waterfowl, nursery and feeding areas for fish, coastal erosion protection, nutrient chemistry functions, and contaminant sequestration. However, since the context contains no information about ocean acidification specifically, it cannot address how ocean acidification impacts species, habitats, and ecosystems as requested.",1,4,0,7
All other assessments,Intertidal Mytilus edulis bed,No medata/ pdf,Intertidal Mytilus edulis beds.pdf,"Climate change represents one of the dominant threats to Mytilus edulis populations and is explicitly identified as a threat in Germany, Netherlands, and Sweden. Climate change effects manifest through changes in temperature, salinity, extreme weather events, higher abundance of predators and infectious agents, which collectively contribute to population decline alongside overfishing as the primary drivers.

Mussel beds are potentially affected by climate change impacts, though Mytilus edulis demonstrates tolerance to wide fluctuations in natural variables. Climate changes constitute a key pressure affecting intertidal mussel beds, alongside hazardous substances, oil pollution, nutrient enrichment, habitat damage, and habitat loss.

Significant knowledge gaps exist regarding climate change effects. The interaction between climate change and mussel-bird relationships requires in-depth study to understand population impacts. Climate change effects on population variability of both mussels and oysters need investigation. Current monitoring systems lack systematic tracking of larvae and spat populations necessary to model population variability and future climate change responses.

Recommendations emphasize establishing systematic monitoring of blue mussel and Pacific oyster larvae and spat to enable modeling of future climate change responses. Multidisciplinary studies are deemed critically important to identify factors responsible for Mytilus population losses, with climate change representing a key component requiring investigation.

The overall decline in mussel beds exceeds 50% over the last 50 years across the Northeast Atlantic, with climate change identified as a contributing factor alongside other anthropogenic pressures. While protection measures in the Wadden Sea have enabled recovery, climate change continues to pose ongoing threats to mussel bed sustainability across the OSPAR Maritime Area.",4,"Climate change is identified as one of the dominant pressures causing decline in mussel (Mytilus) populations across the OSPAR Maritime Area. Climate change effects manifest through changes in temperature, salinity, extreme weather events, higher abundance of predators and infectious agents. These impacts are specifically identified as threatening mussel populations in Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden.

The reports detail that mussel beds are potentially affected by climate change alongside other stressors including fisheries, non-indigenous species, and phytoplankton blooms. Despite Mytilus edulis being naturally tolerant to wide fluctuations in environmental variables, climate change represents a significant pressure on intertidal mussel bed habitats.

Substantial knowledge gaps exist regarding climate change impacts. In-depth studies examining how climate change has affected interactions between mussels and birds are essential to understand population impacts. The effects of climate change on population variability of mussels and oysters require further investigation, as does understanding how climate change influences the interaction dynamics within these marine ecosystems.

The reports recommend systematic monitoring of larvae and spat of blue mussels and Pacific oysters to enable modeling of population variability and future responses to climate change. Data collection protocols should be adapted to account for current and future community compositions under changing climatic conditions. Multidisciplinary studies are identified as critically important for identifying specific factors responsible for Mytilus population losses, with climate change being a key component requiring investigation alongside other anthropogenic pressures.",4,"Climate change impacts species, habitats and ecosystems through multiple interconnected mechanisms, as demonstrated by effects on intertidal mussel bed systems. Climate change represents one of the dominant drivers of Mytilus population decline, manifesting through changes in temperature, salinity, and extreme weather events. These changes increase the abundance of predators and infectious agents that affect mussel populations.

The overall decline of mussel habitat over the last 50 years in the Northeast Atlantic is estimated at greater than 50%, with intertidal mussel beds now rare in some parts of their former range in the Wadden Sea. Despite Mytilus edulis being tolerant to wide fluctuations in natural variables, mussel beds remain potentially affected by climate change alongside other pressures including fisheries, non-indigenous species, phytoplankton blooms, and anthropogenic chemicals.

Climate change specifically alters the interactions between mussels and birds, affecting population variability of both mussels and associated species like oysters. These changes cascade through the ecosystem since mussel beds serve as essential fish habitats, food sources for birds, and play crucial roles in sediment dynamics of coastal systems. The habitat supports a large number of species, making climate impacts on mussel beds significant for broader ecosystem functioning.

Current knowledge gaps include understanding how climate change affects mussel-bird interactions and population variability. Future monitoring must incorporate systematic tracking of larvae and spat populations to model population variability and responses to climate change, enabling better prediction of ecosystem-wide impacts as climate conditions continue to evolve.",4,"Multiple critical knowledge gaps exist regarding climate change impacts on mussel populations. In-depth studies on how climate change has affected the overall interaction between mussels and birds are essential to understand the impact on mussel populations, with multidisciplinary studies identified as critically important for identifying factors responsible for Mytilus population losses.

Climate change effects identified include changes in temperature, salinity, extreme weather events, higher abundance of predators and infectious agents, making climate change one of the dominant reasons for Mytilus population decline alongside overfishing. Climate change is specifically listed as a threat in Germany, Netherlands, and Sweden.

Systematic monitoring of larvae and spat of blue mussels and Pacific oysters is needed so that population variability and future response to climate change can be modelled. More systematic and trilateral harmonised monitoring is recommended to improve understanding and modelling of population dynamics and spatial distributions. This harmonisation may be supported by innovative techniques such as remote sensing via satellites and drones.

Knowledge gaps extend to understanding climate change effects on population variability of both mussels and oysters. Data collection of mussel beds and oyster reefs must be adapted to fit within the context of their current and future communities. Improved knowledge of the interplay between intertidal and subtidal populations is expected to help understand development of both population types.

Regular international harmonised monitoring using internationally standardized programmes across the North Atlantic is needed. Few national monitoring data are available for UK waters, and no recent data exist for Denmark, limiting the ability to assess climate change impacts comprehensively across the region.",5,"Regarding climate change, the report identifies it as a key pressure affecting intertidal mussel beds and provides specific recommendations for monitoring, research, and management actions.

Climate change effects on Mytilus populations include changes in temperature, salinity, extreme weather events, higher abundance of predators and infectious agents. Climate change is identified as one of the dominant reasons for the decline of Mytilus populations, along with overfishing. The threat is specifically noted in Germany, Netherlands, and Sweden.

The primary recommendation is implementing systematic monitoring of larvae and spat of blue mussels and Pacific oysters to enable modeling of population variability and future response to climate change. This should be part of more systematic and trilateral harmonised monitoring programs to improve understanding and modeling of population dynamics and spatial distributions. Harmonisation can be supported through innovative techniques including remote sensing via satellites and drones.

Data collection for mussel beds and oyster reefs should be adapted to fit within the context of their current and future communities. The report advises maintaining current protection measures to allow natural development and recommends reassessing habitat status in six years with investment in harmonised monitoring and data collection.

Several critical knowledge gaps require investigation: in-depth studies on how climate change has affected interactions between mussels and birds are essential to understand impacts on mussel populations. Research is needed on climate change effects on population variability of mussels and oysters. Studies on plantigrade larvae dependence on seagrass and macroalgae as protective refuges before settlement are required. Improved knowledge of intertidal and subtidal population interplay is needed to understand development patterns. Multidisciplinary studies are critical for identifying factors responsible for Mytilus population losses.",5,"Based on the provided context, there is no specific discussion of ocean acidification in this OSPAR report. The document focuses exclusively on the status and threats to intertidal mussel beds (Mytilus edulis) in the OSPAR Maritime Area.

The report identifies climate change as one of the key pressures affecting mussel populations, but the climate change effects mentioned are specifically limited to changes in temperature, salinity, extreme weather events, higher abundance of predators, and infectious agents. Ocean acidification is not mentioned as a climate-related stressor or threat to mussel beds anywhere in the provided text.

The document identifies the dominant reasons for mussel population decline as overfishing of mussel banks (particularly in the Wadden Sea during the late 1980s) and the climate change effects listed above. Other identified threats include pollution, trophic cascading effects from overfishing, invasive species (particularly Pacific oysters), non-indigenous species, phytoplankton blooms, excessive levels of silt and inorganic detritus, and anthropogenic chemicals.

The report notes that mussel beds have declined by over 50% in the Northeast Atlantic over the last 50 years and are listed as endangered on the EU red list of habitats. However, this decline is attributed to the factors mentioned above, with no reference to ocean acidification as a contributing factor or area of concern for mussel bed conservation and management.",1,"The provided context focuses exclusively on mussel bed decline in the OSPAR Maritime Area and does not contain any information specifically about ocean acidification or its impacts on species, habitats, and ecosystems. 

The context extensively documents that mussel beds (Mytilus edulis) have experienced significant declines, with over 50% reduction in the Northeast Atlantic over the last 50 years, making this habitat endangered on the EU red list. Intertidal beds are now rare in parts of their former Wadden Sea range, with significant declines in extent and biomass reported particularly in OSPAR Region II.

The dominant causes identified for mussel population decline are overfishing of mussel banks and climate change effects including changes in temperature, salinity, extreme weather events, higher abundance of predators and infectious agents. Additional threats include pollution, trophic cascading effects, invasive species like Pacific oysters, phytoplankton blooms, excessive silt levels, and anthropogenic chemicals.

Mussel beds serve critical ecological functions as habitat for numerous species including essential fish habitats, food sources for birds, and important components of coastal sediment dynamics. Their decline creates cascading effects on food webs.

While the context mentions climate change as a key pressure affecting these ecosystems, it does not specifically address ocean acidification as a distinct factor or describe its particular mechanisms of impact on marine species, habitats, or ecosystems. The available information cannot answer the specific question about ocean acidification impacts.",1,7,0,8
All other assessments,Leafscale gulper shark,No medata/ pdf,Leafscale gulper shark.pdf,"The provided context does not contain any information about climate change. The entire document focuses exclusively on the status assessment of the leafscale gulper shark, covering aspects such as fisheries pressures, population decline, conservation measures, and management regulations.

The context addresses the species' vulnerability to fishing activities, with stocks considered depleted in the Northeast Atlantic based on substantial declines in catch-per-unit-effort data from 2005. ICES recommends zero catches for 2020-2023, and various fisheries regulations have been implemented including zero Total Allowable Catch quotas since 2010. The species exhibits life-history traits including high longevity (21-71 years maximum age), slow growth rates, and low productivity that make recovery processes slow and render them particularly vulnerable to human impacts.

Key pressures identified relate entirely to fisheries activities - both targeted fishing and bycatch in deep-water fisheries. Conservation measures focus on fishing restrictions, gear limitations at depths greater than 600-800 meters, and prohibition of certain fishing methods. The assessment identifies significant knowledge gaps regarding distribution patterns, stock structure, and population dynamics that require major scientific investment for improved understanding.

However, climate change impacts, temperature effects, ocean acidification, or any climate-related pressures on this deep-water shark species are not mentioned or discussed anywhere in the provided context.",1,"The provided context contains no information about threats or pressures related to climate change for the leafscale gulper shark. The document focuses exclusively on fisheries-related pressures and impacts.

The identified threats and pressures are entirely fisheries-based. The species faces bycatch pressure in deep-water fisheries, despite landings being prohibited since 2010 with only limited exceptions for certain deep-water longline fisheries. Discards from deep-water fisheries occur but have not been quantified for all areas. Ghost fishing from lost nets presents an additional threat, though the duration of impact on deep-water shark populations remains unknown.

The leafscale gulper shark's vulnerability stems from its life-history characteristics including low productivity, high longevity (21-71 years), slow growth rates, and low fecundity (2-12 embryos). These traits render the species particularly susceptible to human impacts and fishing pressure, making recovery processes inherently slow.

Stocks are considered depleted and likely below candidate limit reference points based on substantial declines in catch-per-unit-effort data in ICES subareas 6, 7, and 12. ICES maintains its 2005 recommendation for zero catches, advising zero catches for 2020-2023 under the precautionary approach. All pressures identified in the last assessment have declined following restrictive management measures, with landings of deep-water sharks peaking in 2001-2004 before declining.

The assessment identifies significant data gaps requiring major scientific investment for population monitoring, distribution pattern studies, and spatial overlap assessments with fisheries to develop appropriate conservation measures.",1,"The provided context does not address how climate change impacts species, habitats and ecosystems. Instead, the context contains information exclusively about the leafscale gulper shark's conservation status and fisheries-related pressures in the Northeast Atlantic.

The context focuses entirely on fisheries impacts rather than climate change effects. The leafscale gulper shark was listed as threatened and declining in 2010 due to fisheries depletion, with substantial declines in catch-per-unit-effort documented in ICES subareas 6, 7 and 12. Members of the Genus Centrophorus are vulnerable to fisheries depletion due to life-history characteristics including low productivity, high longevity, and slow growth rates. ICES recommended zero catches since 2005, stating that deepwater shark stocks are depleted and likely below any candidate limit reference point. Landings peaked in 2001-2004 but declined following restrictive management measures, including a zero Total Allowable Catch implemented in 2010.

The species exhibits life-history traits that make recovery processes slow, but abundance and biomass index estimates remain highly variable and uncertain. Current knowledge on deep-water shark species' distribution and stock structure is highly deficient, with life-history and biological information only available for some areas.

The document focuses entirely on deep-water shark species, particularly the leafscale gulper shark, and discusses gaps related to fisheries management and species conservation rather than climate-related issues.

The knowledge gaps identified in this marine species assessment are focused on biological and fisheries aspects. Current knowledge on deep-water shark species' distribution and stock structure is highly deficient for the Northeast Atlantic. Life-history and biological information are only available for some areas and require updating. A major scientific investment is needed to understand spatial and temporal population dynamics that would enable estimates of sustainable exploitation levels.

Specific research gaps identified include the need for increased and rigorous monitoring of deep-water shark populations and development of studies to assess distribution patterns and estimate spatial overlap with fisheries. Additionally, discards from deep-water fisheries likely occur but have not been quantified for all areas, and abundance and biomass index estimates are highly variable and uncertain. The duration of impact from lost fishing nets on deep-water shark populations remains unknown.

The assessment methodology relies on ICES stock assessments, peer-reviewed literature, and expert opinion, but no new information has become available since 2005 to alter advice that the species is depleted in the Northeast Atlantic. However, none of these identified gaps relate to climate change impacts, climate adaptation, or climate-related research needs for marine species or ecosystems.",1,"Based on the provided context, there are no specific recommendations related to climate change. The document focuses entirely on the leafscale gulper shark's conservation status and fisheries-related threats, with no mention of climate change impacts or climate-related research needs.

The recommendations and research gaps identified in the context are exclusively focused on fisheries management and species conservation. Major scientific investment is required to understand spatial and temporal population dynamics that would enable estimates of sustainable exploitation levels. This includes three key research priorities: increased and rigorous monitoring of deep-water shark populations; development of specific studies to assess distribution patterns and estimate spatial overlap with fisheries; and evaluation of the effect on bycatch of modifications in deep-water fishing operations.

Current knowledge gaps center on deep-water shark species' distribution and stock structure being highly deficient in the Northeast Atlantic. Life-history and biological information are only available for some areas and require updating. The species remains depleted according to ICES assessments, with zero catch recommendations continuing since 2005.

Management measures focus on fishing restrictions, including zero Total Allowable Catch adopted in 2010, prohibition of certain fishing gear at depths greater than 600 meters, and various EU regulatory measures.

The context contains comprehensive information about this deep-water shark species, including its depleted status in the Northeast Atlantic based on substantial CPUE declines in ICES subareas 6, 7, and 12. The species exhibits life-history characteristics that make it vulnerable to depletion, including low productivity, high longevity, slow growth rates, and late maturity with only 5-12 embryos per reproductive cycle. Landings peaked in 2001-2004 but declined thereafter due to restrictive management measures, including a zero Total Allowable Catch implemented in 2010.

The assessment reveals that abundance and biomass index estimates are highly variable and uncertain, making current status evaluation impossible. Knowledge gaps include deficient understanding of distribution patterns, stock structure, and population dynamics across the Northeast Atlantic. The species remains subject to bycatch in deep-water fisheries despite landing prohibitions, and gill nets were banned at depths exceeding 600 meters from 2007 due to potential negative impacts on deep-water species.

All other assessments,Leatherback turtle,No medata/ pdf,Leatherback turtle.pdf,"The provided context does not contain any direct discussion of climate change in relation to leatherback turtles in the OSPAR Maritime Area. The report focuses on species distribution, abundance trends, threats from human activities, and conservation measures, but lacks explicit climate change analysis.

The context does reveal some environmentally-related factors that could be climate-sensitive. Limited records of predominantly dead leatherback turtles outside peak season suggest these regions may not represent suitable habitat in winter, likely due to water temperatures and food availability. Peak occurrence in summer months (June-October, particularly August) in UK, Irish and French waters coincides with jellyfish aggregations, with large and diverse jellyfish populations documented in the Pertuis Breton and off southwest England and Wales.

Regional variations in sighting trends show decreasing observations since 2011 in the United Kingdom while increasing in France. The high number of strandings on the French coast in 2019 was attributed to frequent storms that fall, indicating weather pattern impacts on turtle observations.

The report identifies major anthropogenic threats as by-catch (6-8% of records in France and UK), marine debris interaction (40% of necropsied individuals contained marine debris), contamination, and collision. Current pressures are considered likely to continue into the foreseeable future, though insufficient information exists to estimate threat evolution over time.

Significant knowledge gaps remain regarding demography, range, migratory habits and habitat utilisation in the north-east Atlantic. The northwest Atlantic leatherback population is declining and listed as endangered, but no specific climate change impacts or projections are discussed in this assessment.",1,"The OSPAR report identifies climate-related pressures affecting leatherback turtles but provides limited specific detail on climate change threats. Water temperatures and food availability determine habitat suitability for leatherback turtles during winter months, with limited records of predominantly dead animals outside peak season suggesting these regions may not represent suitable habitat due to these temperature-dependent factors.

Climate-related weather events directly impact turtle populations, as evidenced by the high number of strandings on the French coast in 2019 being attributed to frequent storms that fall. This demonstrates how extreme weather events associated with climate change can affect turtle mortality and stranding patterns.

The report notes that leatherback turtle occurrence in summer months coincides with jellyfish presence in OSPAR Regions III and IV, with peak occurrence appearing to coincide with jellyfish aggregations. This suggests that climate-driven changes in jellyfish distribution and abundance could significantly impact turtle foraging success and habitat utilization.

However, substantial knowledge gaps exist regarding climate change impacts. Insufficient information is currently available to estimate the evolution of threats over time, though current pressures are considered likely to continue into the foreseeable future. Important knowledge gaps remain regarding habitat utilization of this species in the north-east Atlantic, and knowledge of the impact of threats is limited.

The report acknowledges that while some climate-related effects are observable - particularly through temperature-dependent habitat suitability and storm-induced strandings - comprehensive assessment of climate change pressures on leatherback turtles requires additional research and monitoring to understand long-term trends and impacts.",4,"The provided context focuses exclusively on leatherback turtle populations in the OSPAR Maritime Area and does not address the broader question of how climate change impacts species, habitats, and ecosystems generally.

The context contains only limited climate-related information specific to leatherback turtles. Water temperatures and food availability determine suitable habitat for leatherback turtles, with regions outside their peak season occurrence not representing suitable winter habitat due to these factors. Peak turtle occurrence in summer months coincides with jellyfish aggregations in Regions III and IV, suggesting temperature-dependent prey distribution affects turtle foraging patterns.

The high number of turtle strandings on the French coast in 2019 was attributed to frequent storms that fall, indicating weather events impact turtle mortality. However, insufficient information exists to estimate how environmental threats to leatherback turtles will evolve over time, though current pressures are expected to continue into the foreseeable future.

The northwest Atlantic leatherback population is in decline and listed as endangered. The species faces slow potential recovery due to low reproductive rates and late sexual maturity. By-catch represents the main anthropogenic threat, followed by marine debris interaction, with 6-8% of records in France and the United Kingdom being by-caught individuals and 40% of necropsied individuals containing marine debris.

Important knowledge gaps remain regarding demography, range, migratory habits, and habitat utilization in the north-east Atlantic, along with limited understanding of threat impacts. The context provides no information about climate change impacts on other species, habitats, or ecosystem-level processes.",2,"Based on the provided OSPAR report context, the document does not specifically discuss gaps in relation to climate change. The context focuses entirely on leatherback turtle status assessment and does not contain any explicit mentions of climate change or climate-related knowledge gaps.

However, the report does identify several significant knowledge gaps relevant to leatherback turtles in the north-east Atlantic. Important knowledge gaps remain regarding demography, range, migratory habits, and habitat utilization of this species. Knowledge of the impact of threats is limited, with insufficient information currently available to estimate the evolution of threats over time.

Available data are currently not sufficient to assess trends (past and future), and the status assessment is based on limited data both spatially and temporally. Therefore, trends could not be determined. Little qualitative or quantitative data are available in the north-east Atlantic regarding fisheries interactions, and interaction with fisheries may not be effectively reported at present.

The report indicates that additional data will be necessary to conclude on the species status at the scale of the OSPAR Maritime Area. There is recognition that existing observation and survey data for leatherback turtles should be better utilized to address knowledge and data gaps.

While the context mentions that limited records outside peak season suggest certain regions may not represent suitable habitat in winter, likely due to water temperatures and food availability, this environmental factor is not discussed in the context of climate change or climate-related knowledge gaps specifically.",1,"The provided context focuses on leatherback turtle assessments but contains no specific recommendations related to climate change. The document mentions water temperatures and food availability affecting turtle habitat suitability in winter months, but does not discuss climate change impacts, adaptation strategies, or climate-related research needs.

The recommendations present are limited to turtle conservation measures: improving fishery observer programs to minimize by-catch impacts, encouraging fishermen to report incidental captures and training them in safe release techniques, and reinforcing monitoring programs through dedicated at-sea surveys. The report calls for continued stranding, by-catch and at-sea records collection, including citizen science contributions, and post-mortem examinations.

Research priorities identified include developing reverse drift models to identify death locations of stranded carcasses, creating strategies to measure contaminant impacts on marine turtles, conducting satellite tagging studies to understand leatherback movements in the OSPAR Maritime Area, and reviewing current turtle observation and survey data flow among Contracting Parties to address knowledge gaps.

Significant knowledge gaps exist regarding leatherback demography, range, migratory habits and habitat utilization in the north-east Atlantic. The impact of various threats remains poorly understood, with insufficient qualitative or quantitative data on fisheries interactions in the north-east Atlantic. Current pressures are expected to continue into the foreseeable future, though insufficient information prevents estimating threat evolution over time.

The context does not address climate change recommendations, research needs, or climate-related issues requiring investigation as requested in the question.",1,"The provided context does not contain any information about ocean acidification. The context consists entirely of an OSPAR report on leatherback turtles, focusing on their distribution, population status, threats, and conservation measures within the OSPAR Maritime Area.

The context identifies the main pressures on leatherback turtles as fishing by-catch, marine litter ingestion and entanglement, contaminants, and collision. By-catch represents the primary anthropogenic threat, with 6-8% of records in France and the United Kingdom being by-caught individuals. Marine debris impacts are significant, with 40% of necropsied individuals containing marine debris. In OSPAR Region V, pelagic longline fishery poses the main threat, with 29 by-caught individuals recorded between 2015-2019.

The assessment notes that leatherback turtles frequent OSPAR foraging grounds during summer months, with peak occurrence coinciding with jellyfish presence in Regions III and IV. The species shows seasonal patterns, with peak occurrence in UK, Irish, and French waters between June and October. However, these regions may not provide suitable winter habitat due to water temperatures and food availability.

While the context mentions that strategies for measuring contaminant impacts on marine turtles should be developed, and that insufficient information exists to estimate threat evolution over time, ocean acidification is not identified as a pressure, threat, or research priority for leatherback turtles in this assessment.",1,"The provided context does not address ocean acidification or its impacts on species, habitats and ecosystems. The context exclusively contains information about leatherback turtle status assessment in the OSPAR Maritime Area, covering their distribution, abundance, threats, and habitat use patterns.

The context focuses on leatherback turtle-specific findings: the northwest Atlantic subpopulation is endangered and declining, with by-catch representing the main anthropogenic threat followed by marine debris interaction. Peak occurrence in UK, Irish and French waters occurs between June and October, particularly in August, coinciding with jellyfish aggregations. Abundance estimates suggest 2,000-3,000 leatherback turtles pass through Irish waters annually, equivalent to 2-5% of the Atlantic population. Regional trends vary, with sightings decreasing since 2011 in the United Kingdom while increasing in France.

The document identifies that 6-8% of records in France and the United Kingdom were by-caught individuals, and 40% of necropsied individuals contained marine debris. Winter habitat suitability appears limited due to water temperatures and food availability. Recovery potential is predicted to be slow due to low reproductive rates and late sexual maturity.

Key knowledge gaps remain regarding demography, range, migratory habits and habitat utilization in the north-east Atlantic, with limited understanding of threat impacts. The assessment acknowledges insufficient data to conclude on species status at the OSPAR Maritime Area scale.

The assessment identifies climate change as one of the primary identified threats responsible for the species' population decline, alongside environmental pollution, other anthropogenic stressors, predation, competition, and food limitation.

Threats from climate change appear to be continuing or increasing specifically in OSPAR region I, where climate change and environmental pollution remain serious threats to the breeding population. The species is considered especially sensitive to various environmental pressures, with climate change being among the key stressors contributing to the general population decline across the entire distribution.

However, significant knowledge gaps exist regarding climate change impacts. The understanding of both singular and interactive effects of climate change remains poor, particularly in combination with environmental pollution, competition with other gull species, predation, fishing, and other threats. This limited understanding contributes to lower confidence in threat assessments for the species.

The direct causes of population development are still not fully understood, despite climate change being clearly identified as a key pressure. The assessment indicates that the general population decline might result from several anthropogenic stressors, including climate change, working in combination with increased predation pressure.

The species faces particular vulnerability as it migrates outside the OSPAR area after breeding, spending winters in the Middle East, eastern Mediterranean, and northeast Africa, potentially exposing it to climate change impacts across multiple regions. The assessment emphasizes that better understanding of climate change effects, both independently and in interaction with other stressors, is needed for effective conservation management.",4,"Climate change is identified as one of the primary threats to the Lesser black-backed gull Larus fuscus fuscus population in the OSPAR Maritime Area. Climate change and environmental pollution remain serious threats, with these pressures appearing to be continuing or increasing in OSPAR region I. 

The species faces multiple climate-related pressures operating both individually and in combination. However, understanding of both singular and interactive effects of climate change with other stressors remains poor, contributing to lower confidence in threat assessments. Climate change interacts with environmental pollution, competition with other gull species, predation, fishing activities, and other anthropogenic pressures, though the mechanisms of these interactions are not well understood.

Climate change contributes to changes in prey abundance and composition, which represents a key threat mechanism. The species is particularly vulnerable as it undertakes long-distance migration to wintering grounds in East Africa, the Middle East, and Mediterranean regions, potentially exposing populations to climate impacts across multiple geographic areas.

The direct causes of population development remain not fully understood, but climate change is consistently identified alongside environmental pollution, anthropogenic stressors, predation, competition, and food limitation as major threats. The general population decline across the species' entire distribution suggests multiple anthropogenic stressors, including climate change, are responsible for continuing population pressures.

The assessment of climate-related threats suffers from lack of understanding regarding joint impacts of multiple stressors. Improved monitoring of breeding success, juvenile and adult survival rates, and conditions at wintering grounds outside the OSPAR area would enhance understanding of climate change impacts on this vulnerable subspecies.",5,"Climate change impacts species, habitats and ecosystems through multiple interconnected mechanisms, though the direct causal relationships remain poorly understood. Climate change functions as a serious continuing threat in OSPAR region I, affecting species through changes in prey abundance and composition. The Lesser black-backed gull Larus fuscus fuscus suffers from altered prey availability, which contributes to exceptionally low breeding success rates across both OSPAR region I and the Baltic Sea.

Climate change operates alongside environmental pollution as persistent serious threats, with both pressures appearing to continue or increase in intensity. These stressors interact with biological factors including predation pressure, competition between species, and food limitations to drive population declines. The general population decline across entire species distributions results from combined anthropogenic stressors, suggesting cumulative rather than isolated impacts.

Breeding success remains critically low, varying strongly between colonies and among years, indicating climate variability affects reproductive outcomes. Adult survival rates become compromised when combined with reduced prey availability and altered ecosystem conditions. Species face increased competition as climate change alters habitat suitability and resource distribution.

The assessment reveals significant knowledge gaps regarding the joint impact of multiple stressors. Understanding of singular and interactive effects between climate change, environmental pollution, competition, predation, and fishing pressures remains poor. This limits capacity to predict ecosystem responses or develop targeted conservation measures.

Long-distance migrants face particular vulnerability as climate change affects both breeding and wintering grounds, with limited monitoring along migratory routes. The complexity of climate interactions with other anthropogenic pressures creates cascading effects throughout marine ecosystems, though quantifying these relationships requires additional research and monitoring efforts.",4,"The report identifies several critical knowledge gaps related to climate change effects on Lesser black-backed gull populations. The understanding of singular as well as interactive effects of climate change remains poor, contributing to lower confidence in threat assessments. This knowledge deficit extends to how climate change interacts with other stressors including environmental pollution, competition with intermedius subspecies and Herring gulls, predation, fishing, and other threats.

Climate change and environmental pollution remain serious threats that appear to be continuing or increasing in OSPAR region I. However, the direct causes of population development are still not fully understood despite climate change being identified as one of the key threats alongside environmental pollution, anthropogenic stressors, predation, competition, and food limitation.

The assessment of threats suffers from a lack of understanding of the joint impact of stressors potentially responsible for the continuation of population decline. The general population decline across the entire distribution suggests it might result from several anthropogenic stressors, but the specific mechanisms and interactions remain unclear.

Current monitoring efforts are limited to nest or individual counts during breeding season at only two monitored breeding colonies within OSPAR region I. Understanding of population development would benefit from inclusion of breeding success data, juvenile and adult survival rates into monitoring programs, and monitoring at wintering grounds outside the OSPAR area. The subspecies is challenging to monitor as a long-distance migrant wintering primarily in East African lakes, with currently few monitoring and conservation efforts on wintering grounds and none along migratory routes.",4,"Based on the OSPAR assessment of Lesser black-backed gulls, climate change is identified as one of the key threats to the species, alongside environmental pollution, predation, competition, and food limitation.

However, the understanding of climate change impacts requires substantial further investigation. There is lower confidence in threat assessment because the understanding of singular as well as interactive effects of climate change, environmental pollution, competition with intermedius and Herring gulls, predation, fishing, and other threats remains poor. The assessment of threats suffers from a lack of understanding of the joint impact of the stressors potentially responsible for the continuation of population decline.

However, insufficient data are available to evaluate the impact of climate change on loggerhead turtles. Cold-stunned turtles are noted to be particularly vulnerable to collision, and these cold-stunning events appear related to climate conditions, with stranding in Region IV occurring generally in winter, likely due to storms, and a peak of observations in winter due to stranding of often cold-stunned individuals.

The report indicates that while climate change is recognized as a threat requiring measures to address key pressures from human activities, the specific impacts remain poorly understood due to data limitations. This represents a significant knowledge gap in understanding how climate change affects loggerhead turtle populations in the OSPAR regions.

The assessment acknowledges that strategies need to be developed to measure various impacts on marine turtles, but provides no specific findings about temperature changes, sea level rise, ocean acidification, or other climate-related parameters. The limited available information suggests climate change effects may be manifesting through increased storm activity and temperature-related stress events that lead to cold-stunning, but quantitative data on these relationships are not provided in the assessment.",2,"Climate change is identified as one of the key pressures affecting loggerhead turtles in the OSPAR Maritime Area, alongside fishing by-catch, marine litter, contaminants, and collision. However, insufficient data are available to evaluate the specific impact of climate change and other threats such as pollution on loggerhead turtle populations.

The report demonstrates some observable climate-related effects on loggerhead turtle behavior and distribution. Winter observations in Region IV show peaks due to stranding of cold-stunned individuals, indicating temperature sensitivity. Cold-stunned turtles may be particularly vulnerable to collision impacts, suggesting climate change could compound other threats through physiological stress responses.

Movement patterns of tagged loggerhead turtles in the Azores are seasonally associated with anticyclonic eddies, which are oceanographic features that can be influenced by climate conditions. This suggests climate-driven changes to ocean circulation patterns could affect turtle habitat use and distribution.

Despite climate change being recognized as a significant pressure, the assessment reveals critical knowledge gaps. The report emphasizes that insufficient data prevent proper evaluation of climate change impacts compared to other better-documented threats. Marine debris ingestion affects 53% and 83% of individuals necropsied in France and Azores respectively, while by-catch from pelagic longline fisheries remains a major threat despite reduced Spanish fishing fleet effort in Region IV.

The species' low reproductive rate and late sexual maturity make recovery potentially slow, which could compound vulnerability to climate-related stressors. However, the report calls for development of strategies to measure climate change impacts and emphasizes the need for reliable indicators of species condition to better assess how climate pressures affect loggerhead turtle populations in OSPAR waters.",4,"Climate change represents a confirmed pressure impacting loggerhead turtles in the OSPAR Maritime Area, alongside fishing by-catch, marine litter, contaminants, and collision. The report identifies climate change as one of the key threats requiring measures to address pressures from human activities.

Climate change specifically affects loggerhead turtle distribution patterns and behavior. In Region IV (Bay of Biscay and Iberian Coast), a peak of observations occurs in winter due to stranding of cold-stunned individuals. These cold-stunned turtles are particularly vulnerable to collision impacts, though insufficient data exist to fully evaluate the magnitude of climate change impacts compared to other threats like pollution.

The species' vulnerability to climate change is compounded by its biological characteristics. Loggerhead turtles have low reproductive rates and late age of sexual maturity, meaning potential recovery from climate-related impacts is predicted to be slow. No breeding or nesting areas exist within the OSPAR Maritime Area, making the population dependent on external recruitment from primarily South-Eastern United States rookeries.

Climate change effects interact with habitat use patterns, as tagged loggerhead turtles show movements characterized by seasonally associated anticyclonic eddies, suggesting their distribution is closely linked to oceanographic conditions that may be altered by climate change.

However, substantial knowledge gaps exist regarding climate change impacts. The report explicitly states insufficient data are available to evaluate the full impact of climate change on loggerhead turtles, and strategies to measure various environmental impacts need development. Information on condition and health aspects remains uncertain, limiting comprehensive assessment of climate change effects on this globally declining, IUCN-listed vulnerable species.",3,"Based on the provided context, there are several significant gaps identified in relation to climate change and loggerhead turtle assessment:

Climate change is identified as one of the key threats to loggerhead turtles in the OSPAR region, alongside fishing by-catch, marine litter, contaminants, and collision. However, insufficient data are available to evaluate the impact of climate change on loggerhead populations. This data gap is particularly concerning for cold-stunned turtles, which may be particularly vulnerable to collision and other threats related to climate effects.

The assessment methodology reveals fundamental data limitations. Available data are currently not sufficient to assess trends (past and future) for loggerhead turtles. The present status assessment is based on limited data both spatially and temporally, preventing trend determination. This limitation extends to climate change impacts specifically.

Spatial data gaps are particularly pronounced. Information in Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction is lacking, which limits the ability to assess climate change impacts across the species' full range. Additional data will be necessary to conclude on species status at the scale of the OSPAR maritime area.

The assessment relies heavily on extrapolation from limited data, expert opinion with very limited data, or in some cases insufficient or no data available. This methodological limitation directly affects the ability to evaluate climate change impacts comprehensively.

Long-term monitoring gaps compound climate assessment challenges. Existing monitoring programs must continue to achieve long time-series to properly evaluate climate change effects. Satellite tagging studies are needed to increase knowledge on movements and distribution patterns, which would help identify how climate change affects habitat use and seasonal distribution patterns.",4,"Based on the provided context, the recommendations regarding climate change for loggerhead turtles in the OSPAR Maritime Area are limited due to significant knowledge gaps.

Climate change is identified as one of five key pressures affecting loggerhead turtles, alongside fishing by-catch, marine litter, contaminants, and collision. However, insufficient data are available to evaluate the impact of climate change on these species. Cold-stunned turtles may be particularly vulnerable to collision, but the broader climate-related impacts remain poorly understood.

The report identifies several critical research priorities that would help address climate change impacts. Reverse drift models should be developed to identify the death location of stranded carcasses. Satellite tagging studies would help increase knowledge on the movements and distribution of loggerheads to identify habitats, improve abundance estimations and knowledge on seasonal distribution. These movement and distribution studies are particularly relevant for understanding how climate change may affect habitat use patterns, as loggerhead movements are characterized by distinct high-use areas seasonally associated with anticyclonic eddies.

Additional monitoring requirements include continuing existing monitoring programs in Region V to achieve long time-series data, which would be essential for detecting climate-related trends. In Region IV, dedicated at-sea surveys to estimate abundance should be prioritized. Information on condition and health aspects of the species, including age/size structure, remains uncertain due to insufficient data, requiring reliable indicators of species condition and adequate monitoring programs.

Future trends (2018-2030) predict decreasing conditions in the Greater North Sea and Celtic Seas, partly due to historic damage that is slow to recover. The combination of maerl's biological sensitivity and the projected climate pressures creates compounding risks for this already threatened and declining habitat across multiple OSPAR regions.",5,"Climate change severely impacts marine ecosystems through ocean acidification and rising temperatures. Ocean acidification has been identified as the most important future threat in the Norwegian Arctic Waters, where temperature increases combined with acidification are predicted to cause a slow but significant reduction of less than 20% over 10 years in maerl bed habitats.

Habitat condition deteriorates significantly under climate pressures. In the Norwegian Arctic Waters, maerl habitat condition is predicted to decrease by less than 20% over the next 50 years (2018-2068) due to degradation by biotic factors linked to climate change. Currently good habitat conditions in this region face declining future trends due to these climate-related stressors.

Species and ecosystems show widespread declining trends across multiple regions. Maerl beds, which support high biodiversity and serve as important habitats for commercial fish and bivalve species, are particularly vulnerable due to their extremely slow growth rates that hinder recovery. Future trends predict decreasing conditions in the Greater North Sea and Celtic Seas through 2030, with historic damage compounding climate impacts.

The extent of critical habitats contracts under climate pressure. Maerl bed extent has decreased over 50 years (1968-2018) in Norwegian Arctic Waters, with continuing future threats from ocean acidification and rising temperatures across all assessed regions. These ecosystems face persistent demersal fishing pressures alongside high future climate threats, creating cumulative impacts that exceed natural recovery capacity given the slow growth rates characteristic of these marine organisms.",4,"Ocean acidification represents the most significant climate-related gap identified in the OSPAR maerl bed assessment. In the Norwegian part of Arctic Waters, ocean acidification is identified as the most important future threat, yet there is insufficient evidence to identify past trends in pressures. This knowledge deficit prevents comprehensive understanding of how acidification impacts have evolved and limits predictive capacity.

Temperature increase compounds this concern, with ocean acidification and rising temperatures together predicted to cause a slow but significant reduction in maerl bed condition of less than 20% over 10 years in Arctic Waters. However, the assessment lacks detailed understanding of these temperature-acidification interactions and their cumulative effects across different regions.

The assessment reveals fundamental data limitations regarding climate impacts. In Arctic Waters, the trend in maerl bed condition from 2010-2019 remains unknown despite current good condition status. The UK was unable to predict future trends due to lack of knowledge on current condition, highlighting critical monitoring gaps.

Spatial knowledge gaps further limit climate impact assessment. The total spatial area covered by maerl in the Northeast Atlantic is unknown, with only a few locations mapped in detail. Complete seabed mapping of all potential areas and establishment of time-series data are needed for in-depth trend analyses of climate impacts.

The assessment relies heavily on expert judgment and limited data, particularly the Norwegian Red List Assessment. Regional assessments depend on expert opinion using mixtures of quantitative data, literature, and knowledge of sensitivity and pressures. These methodological limitations constrain confidence in climate change impact projections and trend identification across the OSPAR maritime area.",5,"Ocean acidification has been identified as the most important future threat to maerl beds in the Norwegian part of Arctic Waters, where it, combined with temperature increases, is projected to cause a slow but significant reduction of less than 20% over 10 years. High future threats from both ocean acidification and rising temperatures are predicted across all assessed regions, with demersal fishing pressures expected to continue throughout these areas.

Climate change impacts are already occurring, as maerl beds were impacted by climate change during the current assessment period (2013-2018). Future projections show declining trends, with maerl bed conditions predicted to decrease in Greater North Sea and Celtic Seas regions from 2018-2030. In the Norwegian Arctic Waters, habitat condition is predicted to decrease by less than 20% over the next 50 years (2018-2068) due to degradation by biotic factors.

Several critical research gaps require investigation. Full seabed mapping of all potential maerl areas must be completed and time-series established to enable in-depth trend analyses. Improved knowledge of human activities and pressure/sensitivity studies is essential to increase understanding of maerl bed status. Current assessments rely heavily on expert judgment and limited data, with the Norwegian assessment based on sparse information and other regional assessments using expert opinion combined with limited quantitative data.

France has initiated research projects involving fishermen and scientists to better understand fishing gear impacts, while the UK collates citizen science data for environmental impact assessments, representing current efforts to address knowledge gaps.",4,"Ocean acidification represents a major future threat to maerl beds across the OSPAR Maritime Area. In the Norwegian part of Arctic Waters, ocean acidification has been identified as the most important future threat to maerl beds, working in conjunction with temperature increases to cause a predicted slow but significant reduction of less than 20% over 10 years (Gundersen et al., 2018). The habitat condition in this region is predicted to decrease by less than 20% over the next 50 years (2018-2068) due to degradation by biotic factors.

Across all assessed regions, ocean acidification poses high future threats to maerl beds, alongside rising temperatures. These threats are particularly significant given that maerl is extremely sensitive to environmental changes, with very slow growth rates that hinder recovery from damage.

Demersal fishing pressures are expected to continue in all assessed regions, compounding the climate-related threats. The combination of ocean acidification and rising temperatures represents a major challenge for maerl bed conservation, especially considering the habitat's slow recovery capacity.

The assessment acknowledges that in the Norwegian part of Arctic Waters, there is insufficient evidence to identify past trends in pressures, making ocean acidification projections particularly important for future management. The slow but significant reduction predicted from ocean acidification and temperature increases highlights the need for proactive conservation measures, as these climate-driven changes may be irreversible on management timescales given maerl's extremely slow growth rates.",4,"Ocean acidification poses the most significant future threat to marine habitats in the Norwegian part of Arctic Waters, where it is predicted to cause a slow but significant reduction of less than 20% over 10 years when combined with temperature increases. This impact specifically threatens maerl beds, which are calcifying marine habitats with extremely slow growth rates that hinder recovery from environmental stressors.

Maerl beds support high associated biodiversity and serve as important habitats for commercial fish and bivalve species. These calcifying organisms are particularly vulnerable to ocean acidification due to their calcium carbonate structure. In the Norwegian Arctic Waters, maerl bed condition is predicted to decrease by less than 20% over the next 50 years (2018-2068) due to degradation by biotic factors, with ocean acidification identified as the primary driver alongside rising temperatures.

The sensitivity of maerl to acidification compounds existing threats from human activities including commercial extraction, mariculture, and demersal fishing. Current assessments show maerl bed condition is decreasing in the Greater North Sea and Celtic Seas, with future trends predicted to continue declining through 2018-2030. The combination of ocean acidification with existing pressures creates cumulative impacts on these slow-recovering ecosystems.

Ocean acidification represents a high future threat across all assessed OSPAR regions containing maerl beds, alongside rising temperatures and continued demersal fishing pressures. The impact is particularly concerning given maerl's role as a foundation species supporting diverse marine communities and commercial species, making the ecosystem-level consequences of acidification effects potentially far-reaching beyond the habitat itself.",4,4,2,7

All other assessments,Offshore renewable energy generation,No medata/ pdf,Offshore renewable energy generation.pdf,Feeder report,1,"The provided context does not directly address climate change as a threat or pressure. Instead, it focuses exclusively on the environmental impacts and pressures from offshore renewable energy installations themselves, which are being developed partly as a response to climate change but are not discussed in that context.

The document identifies multiple pressures from offshore renewable energy developments. Large-scale offshore wind installations by 2050 will have fundamental impacts on North Sea physical functioning, affecting local wind patterns, wave generation, tidal amplitudes, water column stratification, suspended particle dynamics, and sediment transport. These changes will have far-reaching ecosystem consequences for primary production, food availability across trophic levels, and habitat suitability.

Tidal and wave devices create pressures by removing energy from marine systems, potentially affecting local and wider hydrodynamics, particularly with installations above 1.5 GW. Physical seabed and sediment transport impacts include erosion and deposition changes to coastlines and offshore sandbanks, plus bathymetry and geomorphology alterations. Large developments have the highest potential for change, though localized impacts like scouring also occur.

Marine life faces multiple pressures including habitat displacement, collision risks, underwater noise impacts, and electromagnetic field effects from cables affecting benthos, fish, birds, and marine mammals. Most benthic changes remain local and site-specific, with broader spatial effects mainly from tidal barriers or lagoons.

Critical knowledge gaps exist regarding population-level impacts, pressure extent evaluation, and cumulative effects assessment. Data availability limitations compound these uncertainties, requiring strategic research and monitoring to improve understanding of impacts on key receptors and facilitate ecosystem-level approaches to cumulative impact assessments.",1,"The provided context focuses entirely on the impacts of offshore renewable energy installations (primarily wind farms) rather than climate change itself.

The context details how offshore renewable energy developments affect marine environments. Large-scale offshore wind implementation by 2050 will fundamentally alter North Sea physical functioning, affecting local wind patterns, wave generation, tidal amplitudes, water column stratification, suspended particle dynamics, and sediment transport. These physical changes will have far-reaching ecosystem consequences, including impacts on primary production, food availability across trophic levels, and habitat suitability.

Specific impacts on marine life include: benthic habitat changes that are mostly local and site-specific, with broader effects from tidal barriers or lagoons; potential colonization by non-indigenous species on artificial structures; noise impacts on fish and marine mammals from pile driving and maintenance activities, causing physical damage and behavioral changes like habitat displacement; collision risks and habitat displacement for birds and mammals; electromagnetic field effects from cables on fish behavior; and impacts on fish foodwebs due to aggregation around structures.

The context emphasizes that impacts at population levels are poorly understood, pressure extent is difficult to evaluate, and data availability is lacking.

While climate considerations may be implicit in renewable energy expansion goals, the document does not directly address climate change gaps as requested.

However, the context reveals substantial knowledge gaps related to offshore renewable energy environmental impacts that could be relevant to climate adaptation planning. Multiple critical knowledge deficiencies are identified: impacts at population level are poorly understood, the extent of pressures is difficult to evaluate, and data availability is lacking for cumulative impact assessments. QSR 2010 concluded that knowledge about environmental impacts of offshore wind was limited and recommended addressing these knowledge gaps.

ICES highlighted the need for strategic research and monitoring to improve understanding of impacts on key receptors and facilitate ecosystem-level approaches to cumulative impact assessments. Uncertainty remains about the nature and scale of impacts from offshore renewable installations on marine environments, including cumulative effects on habitats, birds, and marine mammals.

The European Commission's offshore renewable energy strategy acknowledges that monitoring and scientific knowledge need development through in-depth analysis, data exchange, and modelling tools to understand potential cumulative environmental effects and interactions with other activities. Regional hydrodynamic models can assess potential impacts, but uncertainties mean continued monitoring is essential.

ICES recommended developing guidance and examples of cumulative impact assessments.

The European Commission's offshore renewable energy strategy acknowledges that monitoring and scientific knowledge need development through in-depth analysis, data exchange and modelling tools to understand potential cumulative environmental effects and interactions with other activities.

Several areas require further investigation: impacts at population level remain poorly understood; collision risks, effects of cables from electromagnetic fields, and behavioral responses to noise require further research and monitoring for fish populations; cumulative environmental impacts assessment faces challenges due to poor understanding of population-level impacts, difficulty evaluating pressure extent, and lacking data availability.

Research needs include understanding environmental impacts through regional hydrodynamic models for tidal and wave developments, continued monitoring given uncertainties involved, and strategic solutions to manage and mitigate impacts. The Offshore Wind Enabling Actions Programme represents a three-year initiative designed to increase understanding of environmental impacts and find strategic solutions.

The document focuses exclusively on fishing-related threats and impacts.

The assessment identifies the greatest threats to porbeagle as mortality in target fisheries and mortality due to bycatch. While measures taken over the past 10 years have reduced these fishing-related threats through various prohibitions and regulations, the risk of incidental bycatch in commercial fishing still exists and cannot be fully mitigated by prohibited species listing alone. Recreational fishing also poses a threat, as porbeagle is highly valued by recreational fishers, and although many practice catch-and-release, post-release mortality remains unquantified.

The entire document focuses exclusively on the Portuguese dogfish (Centroscymnus coelolepis) assessment, covering its population status, fisheries impacts, conservation measures, and knowledge gaps.

The report addresses the species' threatened status, noting it was nominated for inclusion in the OSPAR List of Threatened and/or Declining Species in 2006 due to sensitivity and decline criteria. Portuguese dogfish populations are considered depleted in the Northeast Atlantic, with substantial declines in Catch per Unit Effort recorded in ICES subareas 6, 7, and 12. ICES maintains advice for zero catches during 2020-2023 under the precautionary approach.

Primary threats identified relate to fishing activities, including bycatch in deep-water fisheries and historical targeted fishing. Landings peaked in 2001-2004 but declined following restrictive management measures, including a zero Total Allowable Catch implemented in 2010 for deep-water sharks. Various fishing gear restrictions have been implemented, including bans on gill nets, entangling nets, and trammel nets at depths greater than 600m, and bottom trawling restrictions at depths exceeding 800m.

The assessment highlights significant data limitations, with abundance and biomass estimates being highly variable and uncertain. Knowledge gaps include deficient understanding of species distribution, stock structure, and life-history information. The species exhibits life-history traits that make recovery processes slow, occurring in deep waters from 600m to 1900m depth across a wide Atlantic distribution from Iceland to South Africa.

Climate change impacts on this deep-water shark species are not addressed in this assessment.",1,"The provided context does not address threats or pressures related to climate change affecting the Portuguese dogfish. The document focuses exclusively on fisheries-related pressures and impacts.

The assessment identifies fisheries as the primary threat, noting that Portuguese dogfish is subject to bycatch in deep-water fisheries. Fishing pressure has strongly decreased over the last 15 years following the implementation of a zero Total Allowable Catch (TAC) in 2010, though limited bycatch in longline fisheries targeting black scabbardfish has been permitted from 2017 to 2020. Ghost fishing from lost nets was previously considered a threat but is no longer deemed major given regulations prohibiting static nets at depths greater than 600m, though the duration of impact from any lost nets remains unknown.

The species experienced substantial declines in Catch per Unit Effort in subareas 6, 7 and 12, leading ICES to classify stocks as depleted and likely below candidate limit reference points. All pressures identified in the last assessment are considered to have declined, yet abundance and biomass index estimates remain highly variable and uncertain. Available data are insufficient to fully evaluate current species status, complicated by life-history traits that make recovery processes slow.

The assessment calls for major scientific investment including increased monitoring, distribution pattern studies, and evaluation of fishing operation modifications on bycatch levels. However, no climate change-related threats, pressures, or impacts are mentioned or analyzed in this Portuguese dogfish assessment.",1,"The provided context does not address how climate change impacts species, habitats and ecosystems. Instead, the entire context focuses exclusively on the Portuguese dogfish species assessment, covering its population status, fisheries pressures, geographical distribution, and conservation measures.

The species remains depleted in the Northeast Atlantic according to ICES advice from 2005, with no new information available to alter this assessment. Deep-water shark landings peaked in 2001-2004 but declined following restrictive management measures, including zero Total Allowable Catch implemented in 2010.

The Portuguese dogfish inhabits depths of 600-1900 meters across a wide Atlantic distribution from Iceland to South Africa. Current knowledge gaps include highly deficient information on deep-water shark species distribution and stock structure, with life-history and biological data only available for some areas. Abundance and biomass index estimates remain highly variable and uncertain, with inadequate discard sampling data to provide robust catch estimates.

The context focuses entirely on Portuguese dogfish and deep-water sharks in the Northeast Atlantic, discussing knowledge gaps related to fisheries, species distribution, and population dynamics - not climate change impacts or related data deficiencies.

The context does identify several significant knowledge gaps, but these are exclusively related to fisheries science and species conservation. Current knowledge on deep-water shark species distribution and stock structure are highly deficient in the Northeast Atlantic. Life-history and biological information are only available for some areas and require updating. Available data are insufficient to fully evaluate the current status of Portuguese dogfish, with abundance and biomass index estimates being highly variable and uncertain.

Discards from deep-water fisheries remain likely to occur but have not been quantified for all areas. The duration of potential impacts from lost fishing nets on deep-water shark populations remains unknown. A major scientific investment is required to understand spatial and temporal population dynamics that would enable sustainable exploitation estimates, including increased monitoring of deep-water shark populations, studies assessing species distribution patterns and spatial overlap with fisheries, and evaluation of bycatch effects from modifications in deep-water fishing operations.

All other assessments,Production and consumption of plastics,No medata/ pdf,Production and consumption of plastics.pdf,Feeder report,1,"The OSPAR report identifies greenhouse gas emissions as a key climate-related pressure from plastics. Specifically, plastics contribute to climate change through greenhouse gas emissions generated during their production and lifecycle, alongside other environmental impacts like resource loss and pollution from poorly managed waste.

The report establishes a connection between plastic consumption patterns and climate pressures, noting that lighter-weight plastics in vehicles can reduce fuel consumption, which provides some climate benefits through lower emissions. However, this benefit is offset by the broader climate impacts from plastic production and waste management.

Global plastic production trends indicate intensifying climate pressures, with annual production expected to reach up to 1.2 billion tonnes by 2050. This dramatic increase in production scale suggests correspondingly larger greenhouse gas emissions from the plastics sector unless significant changes occur in production methods and materials.

The report identifies that cheap plastic prices perpetuate a system where reuse and recycling of end-of-life plastics remain low, contributing to continued high production volumes and associated climate impacts. European reviews concluded that plastic consumption and waste issues will very likely intensify in the future, indicating growing climate pressures from this sector.

COVID-19 temporarily disrupted this trend, causing a sharp drop in European primary plastics production in the first half of 2020, with partial recovery later in the year. However, this appears to be a temporary deviation from the overall upward trajectory.

The report emphasizes that future actions must focus on waste prevention and resource-efficient, long-term circular use of plastic products to address these climate-related pressures, though quantitative impacts of current policy measures on total plastic consumption are not yet defined.",4,"The provided context does not address how climate change impacts species, habitats and ecosystems. Instead, the context focuses entirely on plastic pollution and marine litter in the OSPAR Maritime Area.

The context details how plastic pollution affects marine ecosystems through wildlife entanglement and ingestion, with economic impacts on coastal tourism and fisheries. Plastics accumulate in food chains, potentially posing human health risks. Analysis of 585 beach surveys in the North-East Atlantic area found an average of 62 litter items from single-use plastics per 100 meters of beach surveyed in 2015-2016, representing about a quarter of the total 233 litter items per 100 meters. Plastic fragments were the most abundant type of beach litter across survey sites, followed by packaging items.

The context discusses microplastics - particles less than 5 millimeters - which enter marine environments through various pathways including tire and road wear, paint, textiles, and breakdown of larger plastic items. Between 3,100 and 31,000 tonnes of plastic pellets were estimated to have entered the OSPAR maritime area in 2015. European Commission estimates suggest 0.15-0.5 million tonnes of plastic waste entered EU seas in 2015.

The COVID-19 pandemic has created additional marine litter issues through personal protective equipment like face masks and disposable gloves appearing in beach surveys. The longevity of plastics in the environment and uncertainty about their full impact magnitude merit particular attention, given that significant amounts have been introduced relatively recently.

However, none of this information relates to climate change impacts on marine or terrestrial biological systems.",1,"The provided context does not contain specific information about gaps in relation to climate change. The OSPAR report focuses primarily on plastics production, consumption, waste management, and marine litter issues, with only limited mentions of climate-related aspects.

The context does acknowledge that plastics have environmental impacts including greenhouse gas emissions, and notes that lighter weight plastics in vehicles can lower fuel consumption. Additionally, it mentions that plastics can contribute to reductions in land cover change and biodiversity loss when substituting for natural materials.

However, the document does not identify or discuss any specific gaps related to climate change impacts, climate adaptation measures, greenhouse gas emissions from plastics, or climate-related research needs. The gaps mentioned in the context are focused on waste management and pollution prevention, such as the European Environment Agency's conclusion that efforts to prevent plastic waste need to be intensified, better monitoring and evaluation of measures is necessary, and relatively few countries had quantitative targets for plastic waste reduction.

The potential impacts of European targets on recyclability and recycling of plastics on total consumption and marine pollution are noted as not being defined quantitatively, but this relates to waste management rather than climate change specifically. The document's scope appears limited to plastics management and marine environmental protection rather than comprehensive climate change considerations.",1,"The provided context does not contain any recommendations specifically related to climate change or climate-related issues requiring further investigation and research. The entire document focuses exclusively on marine litter, plastic pollution, and waste management in the marine environment.

The context discusses extensive recommendations for addressing plastic pollution, including waste prevention measures, circular economy approaches, microplastics reduction strategies, and marine litter management. However, these recommendations are framed entirely around pollution control and waste management rather than climate change mitigation or adaptation.

The context exclusively focuses on plastic pollution in marine environments, covering topics such as plastic waste management, marine litter, microplastics, and various policy initiatives to combat plastic pollution in OSPAR waters.

Instead of ocean acidification impacts, the context documents how plastics affect marine life. Wildlife suffers harm through entanglement or ingestion of plastic materials. Ecosystem health deteriorates due to plastic pollution, with economic consequences for coastal tourism and fisheries sectors. Human health risks emerge through plastic accumulation in the food chain. The context notes uncertainty about the magnitude of plastic impacts, given that significant amounts have been introduced into the environment relatively recently.

Microplastics, defined as plastic particles less than 5 millimeters, represent a particular concern. These originate from primary sources (manufactured small) or secondary sources (breakdown of larger items), including tire wear, paint, textiles, and decomposition of oxo-degradable plastic bags. Beach surveys in the North-East Atlantic found an average of 62 litter items from single-use plastics per 100 meters surveyed in 2015-2016.

The European Commission estimated 0.15-0.5 million tonnes of plastic waste entered EU seas in 2015, within a global estimate of 4.8-12.7 million tonnes. Major sources include storm water discharges, sewer overflows, tourism-related litter, illegal dumping, and marine activities like shipping and fishing.

The most pervasive gap is insufficient or missing data needed to derive baseline and assessment values across different sub-regions and environmental compartments.

Specifically, statistical assessments were impossible in 187 cases due to data limitations. For H-3 in seawater, assessments could only be conducted in 10 of 15 sub-regions, with 5 sub-regions lacking sufficient annual mean values. Similar patterns emerged for other radionuclides - Tc-99 assessments were limited by insufficient data in multiple cases, and Cs-137 assessments in seawater were impossible in 3 sub-regions because over 80% of baseline period data fell below detection limits.

The data gaps stem from several factors: insufficient annual values (fewer than 2) for baseline or assessment periods, complete absence of data, and excessive detection limits where more than 80% of reported data was below measurable thresholds. For some indicators, data was available for only 2 years across the entire 1995-2018 period.

All other assessments,Right whale,No medata/ pdf,Right whale.pdf,"Climate change represents a significant threat to North Atlantic right whales, though substantial uncertainties remain about its specific effects. The species is highly sensitive to climate change and its direct and indirect consequences, with changes in feeding conditions identified as a key concern.

Climate change could have profound effects on prey density and distribution, which is particularly critical since right whales depend heavily on areas with high densities of suitable prey, primarily calanoid copepods. This dependency makes the species vulnerable to climate-driven shifts in marine ecosystems that could alter the availability and location of their food sources.

The threat operates through multiple pathways. Direct climate effects pose risks, while indirect consequences include alterations to feeding conditions and prey distribution patterns. These changes could force whales to travel greater distances to find adequate food or result in nutritional stress if prey becomes less abundant or accessible.

However, significant knowledge gaps exist regarding climate change impacts on right whales. The assessment explicitly states that ""it is unknown how climate change will affect Right whales,"" highlighting the uncertainty surrounding the magnitude and specific mechanisms of climate impacts on this critically endangered species.

Given the precarious status of right whale populations - with only around 400 individuals remaining in the western Atlantic population and the eastern Atlantic population functionally extinct - climate change adds another layer of threat to a species already facing multiple anthropogenic pressures. The cumulative effects of climate change, combined with existing threats like entanglement and ship strikes, further complicate recovery prospects for this endangered species.",4,"Climate change represents a key anthropogenic pressure and threat to North Atlantic right whales, though the specific effects remain uncertain. The species is particularly sensitive to climate change and its direct and indirect consequences due to its small population size and long lifespan.

The primary climate-related threat involves changes in feeding conditions. Climate change could have profound effects on prey density and distribution, which poses significant risks since right whales depend heavily on areas with high densities of suitable prey, mostly calanoid copepods. This dependency makes the species vulnerable to climate-driven shifts in prey availability and distribution patterns.

However, substantial knowledge gaps exist regarding climate change impacts. It is explicitly unknown how climate change will affect right whales, indicating limited understanding of specific mechanisms and projected consequences. The North Atlantic right whale is extirpated in the OSPAR area, with the eastern Atlantic population functionally extinct and only around 400 individuals remaining in the western Atlantic population.

The species faces multiple concurrent pressures beyond climate change, including entanglement, ship strikes, underwater noise, and pollution. Given the extremely small population size, every individual's survival is critical, particularly reproducing females. The western Atlantic population is not currently recovering due to human-caused mortality.

Actions related to climate change and pollution might benefit the species, though specific measures are not detailed in the assessment. The combination of climate vulnerability, small population size, and multiple anthropogenic pressures creates a precarious situation where climate change represents both a current concern and an uncertain future threat requiring further research to understand potential impacts fully.",4,"Based on the provided context, which focuses exclusively on North Atlantic Right whales, climate change impacts on this species occur through both direct and indirect mechanisms, though significant knowledge gaps exist.

Climate change could have profound effects on prey density and distribution for right whales, which depend heavily on areas with high densities of suitable prey, primarily calanoid copepods. This represents a critical indirect impact, as changes in feeding conditions directly affect whale survival and reproduction. Right whales are particularly vulnerable because they rely on areas close to shore and require consistent access to high-density prey aggregations.

The species shows heightened sensitivity to climate change impacts due to its biological characteristics: it is long-lived with a small population size, making recovery from climate-induced changes particularly challenging. The current western Atlantic population consists of only around 400 animals, with at most 100 reproducing females, meaning the survival of every individual, especially reproducing females, is critical for population persistence.

Climate change ranks among the key anthropogenic pressures affecting the species, alongside entanglement, ship strikes, underwater noise, and pollution. The impacts include both direct effects on the whales themselves and indirect consequences such as altered feeding conditions and ecosystem structure changes.

However, a significant knowledge gap exists regarding climate change effects on right whales - it remains unknown how climate change will specifically affect the species. This uncertainty, combined with the current population status and multiple anthropogenic threats, contributes to the assessment that chances of recovery in the OSPAR area are non-existent in the short term.",3,"The report identifies several critical knowledge gaps regarding climate change impacts on North Atlantic right whales. The most fundamental gap is explicitly stated: it is unknown how climate change will affect right whales. This represents a significant uncertainty given that climate change is identified as a key anthropogenic pressure on this endangered species.

Climate change could have profound effects on prey density and distribution, which is particularly concerning since right whales depend heavily on areas with high densities of suitable prey, primarily calanoid copepods. The species' sensitivity to climate change includes both direct and indirect consequences, with changes in feeding conditions being specifically highlighted as an indirect effect that could impact the species.

Knowledge about the species in the OSPAR area is severely limited, restricted to very few sightings that can often be attributed to individuals from the western North Atlantic population. This lack of observational data compounds the uncertainty about climate change impacts in the region.

The assessment reveals that implementation reporting was not available at the time of publishing, creating an additional information gap. Future status assessments will incorporate implementation reporting against climate-related actions, suggesting current understanding of management effectiveness is incomplete.

While the report acknowledges that actions related to climate change might benefit the species, the specific mechanisms and effectiveness of such measures remain unclear. Given that the North Atlantic right whale is extirpated in the OSPAR area with no prospects for short-term recovery, understanding climate change impacts becomes crucial for any potential long-term conservation strategies, yet this understanding remains fundamentally incomplete.",4,"Based on the provided context, the document identifies climate change as a key threat to North Atlantic Right whales but provides limited specific recommendations due to significant knowledge gaps.

**Key Climate Change Impacts Identified:**
Climate change could have profound effects on prey density and distribution, which is critical since right whales depend heavily on areas with high densities of calanoid copepods. The species faces both direct climate impacts and indirect consequences, particularly changes in feeding conditions that alter ecosystem structure.

**Current Knowledge Gap:**
The most significant finding is that it remains unknown how climate change will affect right whales. This represents a major research need given that climate change is identified as one of the key anthropogenic pressures alongside entanglement, ship strikes, underwater noise, and pollution.

**Recommended Actions:**
The document indicates that actions related to climate change and pollution might benefit the species, though specific measures are not detailed. The report suggests that addressing climate change impacts should be considered alongside other conservation measures, particularly for the critically small western Atlantic population of approximately 400 animals.

**Research Priorities:**
The context clearly identifies the need for further investigation into climate change effects on right whales. Given that the species is long-lived with a small population and is already facing multiple anthropogenic threats, understanding climate impacts on prey availability and distribution patterns is essential for effective conservation planning.

The document emphasizes that with such a depleted population, every individual is crucial for species survival, making climate change research particularly urgent for this endangered species.",3,"The provided context does not contain any specific information about ocean acidification. The document focuses exclusively on the North Atlantic Right whale and its various threats and challenges.

While the context extensively discusses climate change as a key threat to right whales, it does not mention ocean acidification as a component of climate change impacts. The climate-related information provided indicates that climate change could have profound effects on prey density and distribution, as right whales depend heavily on areas with high densities of calanoid copepods. The document notes it is unknown how climate change will affect right whales overall.

The context addresses multiple marine pressures including entanglement, ship strikes, underwater noise, pollution (specifically persistent organic pollutants), and general climate change effects, but ocean acidification is not discussed or referenced anywhere in the provided text. The document represents a species-specific assessment rather than a broader marine chemistry or ocean acidification analysis.

To answer questions about ocean acidification, different OSPAR report sections focusing on marine chemistry, pH levels, carbonate saturation, or broader climate change impacts on ocean chemistry would be needed.",1,"The provided context does not specifically address ocean acidification or its impacts on species, habitats, and ecosystems. The context exclusively focuses on the North Atlantic Right Whale, discussing various threats and impacts affecting this particular species, but ocean acidification is not mentioned among these pressures.

The context does address climate change impacts on marine species, specifically noting that climate change could have profound effects on prey density and distribution for right whales, which depend heavily on areas with high densities of calanoid copepods. Climate change is identified as having both direct and indirect consequences, including changes in feeding conditions. Fishing activities that alter ecosystem structure are noted as a concern, and habitat loss is identified as important since right whales rely on areas close to shore.

The document details other anthropogenic pressures on this marine species including entanglement, ship strikes, underwater noise, and pollution. Persistent organic pollutants negatively affect immune systems and reproduction in long-lived species with thick blubber layers. The extreme population depletion may reduce genetic diversity.

However, since the context contains no information about ocean acidification specifically - its chemical processes, pH changes, or impacts on calcifying organisms, food webs, or broader ecosystem functions - I cannot provide the requested analysis of ocean acidification impacts based solely on this material. The context is limited to one species' status assessment and does not contain the broader oceanographic or ecosystem-level information needed to address the question about ocean acidification.",1,7,0,7
All other assessments,Sea lamprey,No medata/ pdf,Sea lamprey.pdf,"Climate change represents a significant emerging threat to sea lamprey populations in the OSPAR Maritime Area, with impacts manifesting through multiple pathways. At the southern limits of sea lamprey distribution, increasing frequency of dry years with prolonged droughts followed by waterway siltation and fires are expected to severely impact lamprey productivity. These drought conditions create cascading effects, reducing suitable spawning and larval habitat availability.

Climate change-induced flow alteration and increased temperatures in rivers pose additional threats that require further study. The altered hydrological conditions affect the species' freshwater life stages, where sea lampreys spend several years as larvae in river sediments before migrating to sea. Temperature increases in rivers compound existing stressors, potentially affecting larval survival and development.

The impacts extend beyond direct physiological effects to broader ecological disruptions. Climate change affects species distribution patterns and the availability of marine hosts that adult sea lampreys depend upon during their parasitic oceanic life stage. However, this oceanic phase remains poorly understood, representing a critical knowledge gap for assessing climate vulnerabilities.

Current evidence indicates climate change operates synergistically with existing primary threats including dams, habitat fragmentation, pollution, and flow modifications for hydroelectric purposes. While some rivers have shown slight population increases since the 1990s following restoration efforts, climate change threatens to undermine these recovery gains. The species' anadromous life cycle, requiring both freshwater and marine environments, makes it particularly vulnerable to climate-driven changes in both systems.

Research priorities include studying flow alteration impacts, temperature effects on different life stages, and host-parasite dynamics under changing oceanic conditions.",4,"Climate change emerges as a significant threat to sea lamprey populations in OSPAR regions, particularly at the southern limits of their distribution. Increasing frequency of dry years with prolonged droughts followed by waterway siltation and fires are expected to severely impact sea lamprey productivity. Climate change-induced flow alteration and increased temperatures in rivers pose additional threats that require investigation.

The impacts extend beyond direct environmental changes. Climate change affects species distribution patterns and alters the availability of host species that sea lampreys depend upon during their parasitic oceanic life stage. However, the oceanic life stage remains poorly understood, representing a significant knowledge gap for assessing full climate impacts.

Changes in hydrodynamic regimes, particularly those associated with hydroelectrical purposes, compound climate-related pressures by reducing habitat available for the larval stage, affecting both larval survival and spawning possibilities. These alterations to water flow patterns interact with natural climate-driven changes to create cumulative impacts.

The assessment identifies specific research needs regarding climate change impacts. Studies are needed on how flow alteration and temperature increases affect the species, particularly regarding distribution changes and host availability. The interactive effects of climate change with other environmental stressors remain poorly understood, contributing to low confidence in threat assessments.

Climate change represents an emerging pressure that combines with existing threats including habitat loss, pollution, and physical barriers to migration. At southern distribution limits, where climate impacts are most pronounced, these combined pressures are expected to severely compromise lamprey population productivity and long-term viability.",5,"Climate change impacts on sea lamprey species and habitats manifest through multiple pathways in the OSPAR Maritime Area. At the southern limits of sea lamprey distribution, increasing frequency of dry years with prolonged droughts followed by waterway siltation and fires severely impact lamprey productivity. Climate change-induced flow alteration and increased temperatures in rivers affect species distribution and availability of hosts, though these impacts require further study.

Freshwater habitats face degradation through climate-related dewatering, which combines with other stressors like dredging, hypoxia, and degraded water quality to threaten suitable spawning and larval habitat. These conditions result in habitat disruption of spawning grounds and high mortality due to poor water quality, with low larval densities serving as indicators of these impacts.

The species shows particular vulnerability to climate change at different life stages. Adult spawners face restricted access to spawning areas due to altered flow regimes, while larvae experience habitat loss and reduced recruitment success. In one documented case, the River Ave population in northern Portugal has vanished, likely due to combined environmental pressures including pollution.

Climate change compounds existing threats from physical barriers, habitat fragmentation, and water quality degradation. The increasing frequency of extreme weather events, particularly droughts followed by siltation, creates cascading effects on sea lamprey productivity. However, significant knowledge gaps exist regarding the full scope of climate impacts, particularly concerning species distribution changes, host availability alterations, and the oceanic life stage responses. Current research indicates that climate change effects on river flow and temperature regimes require comprehensive study to understand their complete impact on sea lamprey populations across OSPAR regions.",4,"Three primary knowledge gaps exist regarding climate change impacts on sea lamprey populations. First, the impacts of climate change-induced flow alteration and increased temperatures in rivers require study, particularly their effects on species distribution and availability of hosts. Second, the parasitic oceanic life stage remains a ""black box"" for anadromous lampreys, with insufficient understanding of how climate-related oceanographic limiting factors affect spawner numbers and dynamic lamprey-host interactions.

Third, broader knowledge gaps compound climate change uncertainties. Data on abundance and stock structure across OSPAR regions remain inadequate for trend assessment, with Red List status determinations largely based on expert judgment rather than comprehensive data. Several countries have conducted no assessments over the past 10-15 years. Critical missing information includes estimates of stage-specific mortality, distribution at sea, and preferred host species.

The confidence in threat assessments remains low due to poor understanding of singular and interactive effects of environmental factors including climate change, pollution, harvesting, and habitat modification. Current evidence shows climate change already impacts sea lamprey through increasing frequency of dry years with prolonged droughts followed by waterway siltation and fires, particularly at southern distribution limits where these conditions severely impact lamprey productivity. However, the full scope of climate impacts remains poorly understood, necessitating comprehensive research on both freshwater temperature and flow changes, and marine ecosystem alterations affecting the oceanic life stage and host availability.",5,"The context provides specific recommendations regarding climate change impacts on sea lamprey populations. Climate change-induced flow alteration and increased temperatures in rivers require investigation, particularly their impacts on species distribution and availability of hosts. The parasitic oceanic life stage remains a ""black box"" for anadromous lampreys and requires further research.

At the southern limits of sea lamprey distribution, increasing frequency of dry years with prolonged droughts followed by waterway siltation and fires are expected to severely impact lamprey production. These climate-driven changes compound existing threats from habitat degradation, dewatering, dredging, hypoxia, and degraded water quality.

Key research gaps identified include improving data on abundance and stock structure across OSPAR regions to assess trends, as current Red List status relies largely on expert judgment. More information is needed concerning dynamic lamprey-host interactions, combined with studies on oceanographic limiting factors affecting spawner numbers. Understanding of singular and interactive effects of environmental factors remains poor, reducing confidence in threat assessments.

Management recommendations include implementing proper adaptive fishery management through analysis of commercial fishery yield data to detect over-exploitation. Fishways monitoring should provide crucial information on efficiency and help mitigate migration barriers. Optimizing sea lamprey passage through different fishways should be prioritized. The distribution of spawners and redds along rivers may indicate accessibility problems and inability to colonize rivers to their full capacity.

Current management and restoration measures appear highly insufficient for full sea lamprey recovery, with the species remaining threatened across OSPAR regions due to physical migration obstacles, freshwater habitat loss, dams, pollution, and now climate change impacts.",4,"The provided context does not address ocean acidification. The context consists entirely of information from a 2022 OSPAR status assessment focused on sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) populations across OSPAR Regions I-IV (Arctic Waters, Greater North Sea, Celtic Seas, and Bay of Biscay and Iberian Coast).

The assessment documents that sea lamprey populations remain in poor status, with continuous deterioration since 2009. Key threats identified include physical obstacles like dams blocking migration routes, freshwater habitat loss, industrial pollution, dredging activities, and poor water quality. The assessment notes population vanishment in some Portuguese rivers due to pollution and extremely low larval densities in others. Climate change impacts are mentioned only in the context of increased drought frequency, prolonged droughts, waterway siltation, and fires affecting lamprey productivity.

While the assessment identifies oceanographic limiting factors as needing further study and notes that the parasitic oceanic life stage remains poorly understood, ocean acidification is not mentioned as a current or potential threat to sea lamprey populations. The focus remains on freshwater habitat pressures, physical barriers to migration, and general pollution impacts rather than marine chemistry changes.

The assessment calls for improved data on abundance and stock structure, better understanding of lamprey-host interactions in marine environments, and studies of oceanographic factors affecting spawner numbers, but ocean acidification is not specified among the research priorities or identified pressures.",1,"The provided context does not address ocean acidification or its impacts on species, habitats and ecosystems. Instead, the context contains information exclusively about sea lamprey populations in OSPAR maritime regions.

The context reveals that sea lamprey status remains poor across OSPAR Regions I-IV, with populations experiencing significant decline over past decades. The abundance has deteriorated continuously since 2009, with Sweden's Red List status worsening from Nearly Threatened in 2015 to Endangered in 2020. In the Netherlands, numbers declined steadily since 1960, reaching minimum levels in the 1970s-1980s.

Multiple anthropogenic pressures affect sea lamprey populations including physical obstacles blocking spawning access, habitat destruction, reduced water flow, pollution, dredging, hypoxia, and chemical contamination. Climate change impacts through altered flow patterns and increased river temperatures are identified as emerging concerns. In Portugal's River Ave, the sea lamprey population has vanished, likely due to pollution. Increasing frequency of droughts, waterway siltation, and fires are expected to severely impact lamprey productivity.

The parasitic oceanic life stage remains poorly understood, representing a significant knowledge gap. More information is needed concerning lamprey-host interactions and oceanographic limiting factors affecting spawner numbers. Current management and restoration measures are insufficient for population recovery.

All other assessments,Seamounts,No medata/ pdf,Seamounts.pdf,"The provided context does not contain specific information about climate change. This OSPAR report focuses exclusively on seamount habitats and their assessment, examining threats from human activities rather than climate-related impacts.

The report identifies that seamounts have poor status across Arctic Waters, Bay of Biscay and Iberian Coast, and Wider Atlantic regions, with overall habitat condition declining in all regions. However, the primary threats identified are habitat damage and removal of target and non-target species through fishing activities, particularly trawling and commercial fisheries that have expanded since the 1960s. Seamount communities are described as very sensitive to impacts from trawling and commercial fisheries, which continue across all OSPAR regions.

The assessment acknowledges difficulty in determining whether observed changes result from natural variability or anthropogenic impact, but this refers to distinguishing between natural processes and human activities like fishing rather than climate change specifically. The lack of regular monitoring makes it increasingly difficult to determine what changes are taking place, but the documented threats and impacts discussed are exclusively related to fishing pressure, physical damage from trawling, sediment resuspension, and species removal.

While the report mentions ""other less significant current and future threats"" beyond fishing, it does not elaborate on what these threats are or whether they include climate-related factors. The context provided focuses entirely on direct human impacts through extractive activities rather than broader environmental changes associated with climate change.",1,"The provided context does not contain any specific information about threats or pressures related to climate change for seamounts. The document focuses exclusively on fishing-related impacts and other human activities.

The major threats identified are habitat damage and removal of target and non-target species through fishing activities. Seamounts in Arctic Waters, Bay of Biscay and Iberian Coast, and Wider Atlantic regions have poor status due to continued vulnerability to fishing impacts, which damage associated habitats and remove both target and non-target species. Deep-water fisheries have expanded since the 1960s and continue threatening seamount habitats across all OSPAR regions through overexploitation of commercial deep-water fish species.

Additional threats include hunting, harvesting, bioprospecting and extraction of mineral resources. Trawling activities particularly impact seamount communities by targeting commercial pelagic and benthic fish species while also physically damaging suspension feeding fauna. Bottom trawling destroys biological assemblages, increases sediment resuspension, and results in removal of non-target species as by-catch.

The overall habitat condition is declining in all regions, though the physical extent of seamounts remains unchanged. Limited monitoring data makes it difficult to determine whether observed changes result from natural variability or anthropogenic impact, but the documented threats are primarily anthropogenic fishing pressures rather than climate-related factors.

While some seamounts exist within Marine Protected Areas and fishing closures, fishing activities continue across all OSPAR regions. The assessment acknowledges data limitations but identifies ongoing fishing pressure as the primary threat mechanism affecting these vulnerable deep-sea habitats.",1,"The provided context focuses exclusively on seamount habitats and their associated biological communities, with no information about climate change impacts on species, habitats, and ecosystems. The document is entirely dedicated to assessing the status of seamount ecosystems in the OSPAR maritime area.

The context reveals that seamount habitats have poor status in Arctic Waters (Region I), Bay of Biscay and Iberian Coast (Region IV), and Wider Atlantic (Region V), but these impacts are attributed to fishing activities rather than climate change. Overall habitat condition is declining in all regions where seamounts occur due to continued vulnerability to fishing impacts, which damage habitats and remove both target and non-target species, particularly in Regions IV and V.

The primary threats identified are habitat damage and removal of target and non-target species through trawling and commercial fisheries. Deep-water fisheries have expanded since the 1960s, with bottom trawling abrading the seafloor and its biological assemblages, increasing sediment resuspension, and resulting in removal of non-target species as by-catch. Deep water fish are especially vulnerable to overexploitation due to their slow growing, late reproducing life history characteristics.

The assessment notes that seamount communities are very sensitive to impacts from trawling and commercial fisheries, with fisheries activities occurring across all OSPAR regions. However, there is low confidence in the scale of fishing pressure and limited monitoring data, making direct condition assessments challenging for many seamounts that have no associated data.

The document contains no information about temperature changes, ocean acidification, sea level rise, or other climate-related impacts on marine species, habitats, or ecosystems.",1,"The report identifies several critical knowledge gaps that severely limit the ability to understand climate change impacts on seamounts. The lack of regular monitoring makes it increasingly difficult to determine what changes are taking place and whether changes result from natural variability or anthropogenic impact, including climate-related changes.

The presence and abundance of key species on seamounts and quality of abiotic components across the OSPAR Regions are not known due to limited monitoring data. This data paucity makes direct condition assessments challenging. Many seamounts have no data associated with them, and numerous seamounts have not been mapped or investigated in any detail, which would provide much needed baseline information.

Information about seamounts comes only from sporadic research cruises and mining of historical data rather than systematic monitoring. There is no coordinated monitoring programme across the region. The assessment relies on expert opinion with very limited data, and available datasets are not comprehensive, requiring analyses to rely on assumptions.

The report notes low confidence in the scale of current pressures on seamounts. Iceland has not surveyed their seamount habitats due to lack of infrastructure and associated costs. Few seamounts in the three regions where they are found have been extensively studied.

While the report does not explicitly mention climate change gaps, these fundamental monitoring and knowledge deficiencies would severely limit any ability to detect, attribute, or assess climate change impacts on seamount ecosystems. The lack of baseline data, regular monitoring, and understanding of natural variability versus anthropogenic changes represents a critical gap for climate change research on these deep-sea habitats.",4,"Based on the provided context, the OSPAR report focuses exclusively on seamount habitats and does not contain specific recommendations related to climate change. The document does not mention climate change as a threat or pressure, nor does it discuss climate-related impacts on seamounts.

The recommendations and research needs identified in the report relate to general seamount conservation and monitoring rather than climate change specifically. The primary recommendations include establishing repeat monitoring programs for seamounts to better inform future prospects of this habitat, since irregular monitoring makes it increasingly difficult to determine what changes are taking place and whether changes result from natural variability or anthropogenic impact. 

The report identifies significant knowledge gaps requiring investigation: numerous seamounts have not been mapped or investigated in any detail, and comprehensive baseline information is needed. Regular monitoring is absent across OSPAR regions, with information collected only through occasional research cruises rather than coordinated monitoring programs. The presence and abundance of key species on seamounts and quality of abiotic components across OSPAR regions are not known due to limited monitoring data.

Several countries are addressing these gaps through various approaches. Norway and Spain are increasing knowledge of seamount occurrence and threats through management plans, Iceland will undertake research programs to expand their seamount knowledge base, and France, Norway and Spain operate programs for monitoring seamounts or mapping vulnerable marine ecosystems.

The context addresses seamount distribution (161 seamounts predicted within the OSPAR Maritime Area), condition assessments (poor status in all regions due to fishing impacts), threats (primarily habitat damage from bottom trawling and removal of target and non-target species), monitoring gaps (lack of regular coordinated monitoring programs), and conservation measures (various national legislation and NEAFC closures for bottom-contacting fishing gear).

The assessment identifies that seamount communities are declining across all regions, with major pressures from commercial fishing activities that damage seafloor biological assemblages through trawling, increase sediment resuspension, and remove species as by-catch. However, there is no mention of ocean acidification as a pressure, threat, or factor affecting seamount ecosystems, nor any discussion of pH changes, carbonate chemistry, or related acidification impacts on marine environments.

Climate change is mentioned only briefly as one of the pressures affecting these marine habitats, appearing in two simple lists alongside other threats: ""Fisheries Climate change Aquaculture Organic"" and ""Trawling Fisheries Climate change Aquaculture.""

The document provides no detailed analysis of climate change impacts, no specific data on temperature changes, ocean acidification, sea level rise, or other climate-related parameters. There are no findings regarding how climate change specifically affects sea-pen and burrowing megafauna communities, nor any projections of future climate impacts on these habitats.

The assessment focuses extensively on other pressures, particularly bottom-contacting fishing gears, which are identified as the main threat across multiple OSPAR regions from 2015 to 2021. Detailed analysis is provided on fishing impacts, with findings such as 58% of assessed areas being classified as 'highly disturbed' and consistent fishing pressure occurring over 74% of assessed OSPAR areas. Aquaculture expansion is also discussed in detail, with projections of 37% output increase in Scottish waters by 2030.

The limited mention of climate change suggests either that climate impacts on these specific habitats are not well understood, not considered a primary threat compared to fishing pressures, or that climate change effects were not within the scope of this particular assessment. The document does not explain why climate change receives such limited attention or provide any gaps analysis regarding climate change research needs.",2,"The provided context does not contain specific information about climate change as a threat or pressure to sea-pen and burrowing megafauna communities. While ""Climate change"" appears once in a brief list of pressures on page 1, no detailed discussion, data, or analysis of climate-related impacts is presented in the document.

The context focuses extensively on other major threats to these marine habitats. Bottom-contacting fisheries represent the most widespread direct pressure, with 86% of assessed areas physically disturbed and 58% classified as highly disturbed. Consistent fishing pressure occurs over 74% of assessed OSPAR areas and significantly affects habitat recovery ability. This pressure leads to sediment resuspension causing oxygen depletion, removal of target and non-target species including sea-pens, reduced sediment complexity, and shifts toward short-lived species with reduced habitat complexity.

Aquaculture expansion poses another significant threat, projected to grow in all OSPAR regions with a 37% output increase forecast in Scottish waters by 2030. Finfish aquaculture threatens benthic environments through organic enrichment causing seabed oxygen depletion, and chemical contamination from therapeutants, antifoulants, feed additives, and net washings. Ammonia increases from expanding aquaculture have been reported in Norway, while heavy metals and pesticides accumulate in surrounding sediments.

Additional threats include habitat loss from infrastructure development and pollution from land-based and marine industrial sources. The habitat shows particular vulnerability to organic enrichment, with burrowing megafauna absent when sediment organic content exceeds 6% but common below 4%. The document indicates that despite some fishing pressure reductions, habitats remain at unsustainable disturbance levels, particularly affecting sensitive species like Funiculina quadrangularis.",1,"Based on the provided OSPAR report context, climate change is mentioned as one of the pressures affecting sea-pen and burrowing megafauna communities, but the document contains extremely limited specific information about climate change impacts on species, habitats and ecosystems.

The context primarily focuses on fishing pressures rather than climate change effects. The most relevant finding related to potential climate impacts is that the age at which female Nephrops norvegicus first reach sexual maturity has declined significantly over two decades in the Western Irish Sea, suggesting ongoing stress on the habitat despite reduced fishing pressure. However, this change is not explicitly attributed to climate change in the provided text.

The document demonstrates extensive impacts from other pressures that may parallel or compound climate effects. Bottom-contacting fisheries cause shifts to short-lived species, reduce habitat complexity, remove fragile benthic species, and lead to shifts in benthic communities. These activities result in irreversible shifts in benthic trophic structure and cause loss of more sensitive characterizing species. In assessed OSPAR areas, 86% were physically disturbed with 58% classified as highly disturbed, and consistent fishing pressure occurred over 74% of areas, affecting habitat recovery ability.

The habitat shows sensitivity to environmental changes, with burrowing megafauna absent when sediment organic content exceeds 6% compared to being common below 4%. Sea-pens demonstrate vulnerability due to their erect, sessile nature and inability to retract into sediment.

The explicitly stated knowledge gaps include: insufficient assessment data across all OSPAR regions (Region I, II, III and IV), lack of established pressure thresholds relating to varying intensity of fishing pressure and habitat condition, and absence of shared understanding of the habitat definition.

Additional data limitations mentioned include: the habitat is not fully mapped, total extent in OSPAR waters remains unknown, condition assessments are unknown in Arctic Waters and Bay of Biscay and Iberian Coasts due to limited data availability, and confidence levels are low for Region I and Region IV due to lower data volumes for analysis.

The context focuses primarily on fishing pressure as the main documented threat, with bottom-contacting fishing gears continuing as the primary threat from 2015 to 2021 in Greater North Sea and Celtic Seas regions. While aquaculture expansion and its localized impacts are discussed in detail, and infrastructure development and pollution are mentioned as potential threats, climate change receives no substantive treatment in the available text.

Bottom-contacting fishing gear represents the main threat from 2015-2021 in the Greater North Sea and Celtic Seas regions, with 58% of areas classified as 'highly disturbed' and consistent fishing pressure over 74% of assessed OSPAR areas. The report identifies that despite reduced fishing pressure, habitats have not yet reached sustainable disturbance levels.

Key recommendations center on fisheries management and habitat protection. Twenty Marine Protected Areas are designated in the United Kingdom specifically for sea-pen conservation, with further fisheries measures to reduce habitat degradation from bottom-towed gears planned. A joint EU Commission proposal with Sweden and Denmark has banned bottom trawling in Kattegat sites to protect sea-pen communities.

Research priorities requiring further investigation include: developing new methods and techniques to increase knowledge of deep-sea ecosystems; establishing novel management tools to prevent adverse human impacts; continuing habitat mapping since total extent remains unknown; and improving fishing distribution data through increased VMS ping rates for vessels over 12 meters.

Aquaculture expansion is projected across all OSPAR regions with a 37% increase forecast in Scottish waters by 2030.

The report discusses oxygen depletion resulting from organic matter breakdown and sediment resuspension, increases in ammonia from expanding aquaculture, and accumulation of heavy metals, pesticides and mycotoxins in sediments. However, these impacts relate to local pollution and eutrophication rather than ocean acidification from atmospheric CO2 absorption.

While the context mentions chemical changes in marine environments, none specifically address pH changes, carbonate chemistry, or acidification processes that would typically be discussed in relation to ocean acidification. The scope of this particular OSPAR assessment appears limited to habitat-specific pressures on benthic communities rather than broader ocean chemistry changes.

Instead, the context focuses exclusively on sea-pen and burrowing megafauna communities and their responses to fishing pressures, aquaculture impacts, and physical disturbance.

The context documents how bottom-contacting fisheries physically disturb the seabed, resulting in reduction of sediment complexity, removal of species and damage to fragile benthic species, leading to shifts in benthic communities. These fisheries cause irreversible shifts in benthic trophic structure through removal of target and non-target species including sea pens, and through sediment resuspension causing oxygen depletion in areas with limited water exchange. Sea-pen communities continue to be threatened and declining across Greater North Sea and Celtic Seas regions, with 86% of assessed areas physically disturbed and 58% classed as highly disturbed. Consistent fishing pressure occurred over 74% of assessed areas and was considered very likely to affect habitat recovery ability.

The habitat shows sensitivity to organic enrichment and contaminants from finfish aquaculture, with organic enrichment from cage aquaculture resulting in oxygen depletion on the seabed. Larger species like F. quadrangularis show greater sensitivity to physical disturbance, occurring at eight times higher density on protected sites compared to trawled sites, while smaller species such as Virgularia spp. and burrowing fauna including Nephrops norvegicus are less sensitive.

All other assessments,Shipping and ports,No medata/ pdf,Shipping and ports.pdf,Feeder report,1,"Climate change presents several significant threats and pressures to marine shipping activities. Arctic shipping routes face increasing risks as the Arctic shipping season is projected to triple in length by mid-century, with ship traffic in the Arctic Polar Code area growing by 25% between 2013 and 2019 due to ice sheet thinning. While this creates potential shipping shortcuts saving 10-12 days between East Asia and Europe, the viability remains uncertain due to trade-offs between shorter distances and higher Arctic shipping costs.

Climate change directly increases the risk of introducing non-indigenous species through multiple pathways. Changing shipping routes, combined with environmental disturbance from port development and climate impacts, elevate the risk of species transfer via biofouling. The risk is further compounded if global shipping trade increases as projected.

Black carbon emissions from shipping pose a particularly serious climate threat in Arctic routes, where deposition on snow and ice reduces sunlight reflection and accelerates melting rates. This creates a feedback loop intensifying Arctic warming. Additionally, shipping emissions contribute to ocean acidification and eutrophication through atmospheric deposition at sea.

Climate-related supply chain disruptions are identified as a key factor that could limit future trade growth, alongside economic transitions and regionalized trade flows. Transport of oil and petroleum products from northwestern Russia has increased, with capacity from Russian Arctic export terminals projected to grow, raising concerns about oil tanker accident risks unless mitigation measures are implemented.

The shipping industry is responding through IMO strategies targeting 40% carbon intensity reduction by 2030 and 70% by 2050, promoting energy efficiency improvements and alternative fuels development, though implementation challenges remain significant.",5,"Based on the provided context, climate change impacts on species, habitats and ecosystems are mentioned only briefly and indirectly in relation to shipping activities. The context does not provide a comprehensive analysis of climate change impacts on marine life.

The most direct reference indicates that climate change could increase the risk of non-indigenous species introduction through shipping vectors, alongside other factors such as changing shipping routes, slower shipping speeds, and environmental disturbance from port development. However, the specific mechanisms by which climate change affects this risk are not detailed.

The context references ice sheet thinning as a factor driving increased Arctic shipping traffic. Between 2013 and 2019, ship traffic in the Arctic Polar Code area grew by 25% to 1,628 vessels, with distance sailed increasing by 75% to 9.5 million nautical miles, partially due to ice sheet thinning alongside increased resource extraction and tourism.

Black Carbon deposition from Arctic shipping routes reduces sunlight reflection on snow and ice, accelerating melting rates, which represents an indirect climate feedback effect rather than a direct impact on marine species or habitats.

Shipping emissions contribute to ocean acidification and eutrophication through atmospheric deposition at sea, with 97% of North Sea emissions released within 100 nautical miles of shore. These processes can affect marine ecosystems, though the context does not elaborate on specific impacts to species or habitats.

The Arctic shipping season is projected to triple in length by mid-century, though market potential remains uncertain unless Arctic waters become reliably ice-free.

The provided context primarily focuses on shipping impacts rather than comprehensive climate change effects on marine ecosystems, limiting the scope of information available to address the question directly.",2,"The OSPAR reports identify several significant gaps related to climate change impacts on shipping and marine environments.

Monitoring of non-indigenous species represents a particular gap in knowledge for implementing the Marine Strategy Framework Directive. This monitoring challenge becomes more critical as climate change impacts could increase the risk of species introductions through biofouling, alongside other factors like changing shipping routes and slower shipping speeds.

Knowledge gaps exist regarding underwater noise effects, as only a few marine mammal and fish species have been tested for hearing range and sensitivity, despite shipping being the major source of anthropogenic underwater noise. The reports call for improved assessment and data on shipping impacts, including ship noise effects on marine mammals.

Arctic shipping presents emerging uncertainties tied to climate change. While the Arctic shipping season is projected to triple in length by mid-century due to ice sheet thinning, and ship traffic in the Arctic Polar Code area grew 25% between 2013-2019, whether trans-Arctic routes will become economically viable remains unclear. The market potential for Arctic shipments remains uncertain, though this could change if the Arctic becomes reliably ice-free.

The reports highlight insufficient understanding of whether Arctic transport growth from increased resource extraction and tourism, combined with climate-driven route changes, will create additional environmental risks. Black Carbon emissions from Arctic shipping routes pose particular climate forcing concerns, as deposition on snow and ice reduces sunlight reflection and increases melting rates.

Assessment capabilities need improvement for determining whether shipping activities compromise good environmental status, particularly regarding noise impacts in high-risk areas and sensitive species distribution zones. The reports emphasize needs for better measurement, monitoring and reporting systems across multiple climate-related shipping impacts.",4,"The OSPAR report identifies multiple climate change-related recommendations spanning emissions reduction, Arctic shipping impacts, and technological innovation.

IMO's 2018 greenhouse gas reduction strategy for shipping targets carbon intensity reductions of at least 40% by 2030 and 70% by 2050. This strategy emphasizes improving energy efficiency frameworks and developing low-carbon fuels and innovative technologies. Energy efficiency improvements focus on operational enhancements and design features including better hull design and propulsion aids like sails or kites. Alternative fuels under development include liquified natural gas, electrofuels such as hydrogen or methanol, battery power, ammonia, and biodiesel or biogas.

Black Carbon emissions from shipping present a critical climate forcing concern, particularly in Arctic shipping routes where deposition on snow and ice reduces sunlight reflection and accelerates melting rates. The Arctic shipping season is projected to triple in length by mid-century, potentially creating new trans-Arctic routes that could supplement traditional Suez Canal routes, though economic viability remains uncertain unless the Arctic becomes reliably ice-free.

Several areas require further investigation. Evidence on the impact of port incentive schemes for cleaner shipping remains limited, though development of more substantial incentives could facilitate further decarbonization. The EU is funding research projects for water-borne transport decarbonization, including electric ferries and novel materials to reduce ship weight. Research continues on sustainable antifouling solutions and the likelihood of microplastic release from marine paints.

Additional research needs include better assessment frameworks for exhaust gas cleaning systems' environmental impacts, with IMO launching new work in 2019 to develop guidelines and regulations. The report also identifies needs for improved measurement, monitoring and reporting of discharges, and regulations on scrubber water discharge limits.",5,"Ocean acidification is identified as a consequence of shipping emissions deposited at sea. In the North Sea, 97% of shipping emissions are released within 100 nautical miles of the coast due to increased shipping activity near ports, meaning these emissions contribute significantly to both air pollution on land and deposition at sea that leads to acidification and eutrophication effects.

The acidification issue is further compounded by exhaust gas cleaning systems (scrubbers) used on ships. These systems allow vessels to use high sulphur heavy fuel oil while reducing sulphur oxide emissions, but they discharge large volumes of acidified water containing contaminants including heavy metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, oil residues and nitrates. Open loop scrubbers, which are the most common type, discharge these acidified waters directly to the sea. This is particularly concerning in areas of high traffic density and in ports close to environmentally sensitive areas.

The International Maritime Organization's Marine Environment Protection Committee launched a new work strand in 2019, initiated by EU member states, to address the impact of exhaust gas cleaning systems on human health and the marine environment. This work aims to develop risk and impact assessment frameworks and potentially develop guidelines and regulations restricting discharges from these systems.

The reports indicate that shipping emission trends are anticipated to increase up to 2050 based on European Commission studies examining the feasibility of extending Emission Control Areas in all EU seas, suggesting ocean acidification from shipping sources may continue to be a growing concern without additional measures.",4,"The provided context contains very limited information specifically about ocean acidification's impacts on species, habitats and ecosystems. The available information focuses primarily on acidification as a byproduct of shipping activities rather than comprehensive ecological impacts.

Shipping emissions contribute to acidification through atmospheric deposition at sea, with 97% of North Sea emissions released within 100 nautical miles of shore due to concentrated port activities. Additionally, exhaust gas cleaning systems (scrubbers) used by ships discharge large volumes of acidified water directly into marine environments. These open-loop scrubbers release acidified waters containing heavy metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, oil residues and nitrates, creating particular concern in high traffic density areas and ports near environmentally sensitive regions.

However, the context does not provide specific information about how ocean acidification affects marine species, their behaviors, physiology, or survival rates. It lacks details on habitat degradation, ecosystem-level changes, or impacts on food webs due to acidification. The context does not address effects on calcifying organisms, coral reefs, shell-forming species, or other organisms typically vulnerable to acidification.

While the context extensively covers other shipping-related environmental impacts including underwater noise effects on marine mammals and fish (hearing damage, behavioral disruption), introduction of non-indigenous species, physical disturbance of seafloor habitats, and chemical pollution, it does not elaborate on the specific mechanisms or consequences of ocean acidification on marine ecosystems. The available information is insufficient to comprehensively answer how ocean acidification impacts species, habitats and ecosystems beyond identifying shipping as a source of acidifying compounds.",2,,,

Habitat damage from mobile fishing gears, pollution, and eutrophication was considered but not evaluated in previous assessments.

Current pressures are categorized as excessive mortality from bycatch fisheries and habitat damage. Fishing pressure is regulated through a Group-TAC system covering all skate and ray species except Raja undulata in EU waters.

Stock size indicators show increasing trends in some regions, particularly OSPAR Region II since 2009, with more recent increases in Regions III and IV over the last decade, though these have wide confidence limits. The species remains rare in Belgian, German, Norwegian, and Swedish waters.

Knowledge gaps include incomplete delineation of spawning and nursery grounds, undefined population structure, and limited understanding of gear selectivity and discard survival. Additional research needs include tagging programs and DNA analyses throughout the species' distributional range.

The document focuses entirely on other categories of threats and pressures affecting this species in the OSPAR Maritime Area.

The identified threats are primarily fisheries-related and habitat-related. Bycatch remains a significant pressure despite targeted fishing prohibitions since 2011, occurring primarily in mixed demersal and gill net fisheries with unknown discard survival rates. Habitat loss and degradation represent major concerns, with coastal development, pollution, dredging and bottom trawling affecting habitats critical to spurdog and their prey species. Mobile fishing gears and pollution cause direct damage to spurdog natural habitats.

Knowledge gaps exist regarding the effects of pollutants and habitat degradation on spurdog populations. Additionally, accurate data on pupping and nursery ground locations and their stock importance are lacking, preventing effective spatial management approaches.

The Northeast Atlantic spurdog stock declined severely over the second half of the 20th century, reaching approximately 24% of virgin biomass, though recent indicators suggest recovery with improved recruitment over the last decade. The species remains particularly vulnerable due to its very low intrinsic rate of increase, slow growth, late maturation, and biennial reproductive cycle with 18-25 month gestation periods.

Instead, the context focuses exclusively on the spurdog species in the Northeast Atlantic and discusses various anthropogenic pressures affecting this specific species.

The context identifies several impacts on spurdog habitats and the species itself, but these are primarily attributed to human activities rather than climate change. Coastal development, pollution, dredging and bottom trawling affect the habitats on which spurdog and their prey are reliant. Mobile fishing gears and pollution cause damage to spurdog's natural habitat, leading to habitat loss and degradation. The spurdog stock declined severely over the second half of the 20th century and currently remains at approximately 24% of virgin biomass, though recent data suggests the stock is now increasing.

The spurdog demonstrates particular vulnerability due to its very low intrinsic rate of increase and slow recovery from depletion.

The report emphasizes the need to assess whether the MPA network is ""representative and resilient"" for threatened and declining features, suggesting climate resilience is a consideration in network design. However, the document does not provide specific details about what climate change pressures are affecting marine ecosystems, how these pressures manifest in the OSPAR Maritime Area, or their particular impacts on protected species and habitats.

Climate change appears to be recognized as a known pressure requiring management actions within MPAs, as site managers are expected to identify and address ""known threats and pressures"" to protected features.

Future work should address these geographical gaps.

Critical knowledge and data gaps impede effective assessment and management. The high complexity of marine ecosystems combined with knowledge gaps on current ecological status create considerable uncertainties in quantifying benefits of MPAs. Sufficient data for cost-benefit analyses are lacking due to missing long-term ecological monitoring programmes. A lack of understanding about the pristine state of areas impedes valuing current area quality.

Database deficiencies present significant gaps. The OSPAR MPA database is deficient in information regarding protection of EUNIS Level 3 habitat types and OSPAR threatened/declining features. All geographically explicit ecological data is deficient, creating accuracy issues regarding spatial resolution and data collection methods.

Monitoring gaps are widespread. Most sites had monitoring to ensure positive conservation outcomes for biodiversity missing. Resource constraints are cited as significant barriers to implementing regular ecological monitoring programmes. Site-specific data on ecological status of protected features are frequently unavailable, with 20% of responses indicating it was unknown whether protected features are moving toward conservation objectives.

A climate-related oceanographic shift in wintering grounds, associated with ocean warming, has resulted in reduced food supplies and consequently reduced survival and recruitment rates. This climate-driven impact on food availability during the non-breeding season constitutes the main threat to declining populations.

Breeding populations in Svalbard, East Greenland, and northern Norway are currently declining at rates of 2-5% annually, with climate change and its indirect effects identified as the most likely pressures driving these negative trends. Some populations face potential extirpation within 40-50 years if current trends continue. Adult survival rates on Bjørnøya declined by 9-12% from 1995/1998 to approximately 2010, though recent years have shown some improvement.

The species exhibits high vulnerability to climate impacts due to its life-history characteristics - being long-lived with slow reproduction rates means populations recover slowly from reductions. Birds from declining populations share common wintering grounds off Southwest Greenland, where climate-associated effects most severely impact food availability and survival rates.

Assessment confidence regarding climate threats remains medium because determining future climate change impacts on populations is challenging, particularly during the non-breeding season when birds distribute across large offshore areas. An in-depth understanding of how climate change affects population status is needed, though future effects and indirect consequences like reduced food availability are difficult to assess.

Climate-related oceanographic shifts in wintering grounds, associated with ocean warming, have resulted in reduced food supplies and consequently reduced survival and recruitment rates. These climate-associated effects impacting food availability and survival rates in common wintering grounds are considered the main threat driving current population declines in Svalbard, East Greenland, and northern Norway.

The populations are experiencing significant synchronous declines of 2-5% annually since the late 1990s, with some facing potential extinction within 40-50 years. Climate change operates through indirect effects, particularly limited prey availability during the critical non-breeding season when birds are distributed over large offshore areas.

Additional threats compound the climate impacts, including hunting (primarily in Greenland), predator disturbance (especially in northern Norway), chemical pollution (mercury levels exceeding thresholds in some populations), and oil pollution. The species' vulnerability is heightened by its slow life-history characteristics - being long-lived with slow reproduction means populations recover slowly from reductions.

Assessment confidence remains medium for threat evaluation because determining future climate change impacts and consequences on BRGU populations is challenging, particularly during non-breeding seasons. An in-depth understanding of how climate change affects population status is needed, but future effects of climate change and indirect consequences like lower food availability are difficult to assess.

Ocean warming has triggered climate-related oceanographic shifts in wintering grounds, resulting in reduced food supplies and consequently reduced survival and recruitment rates. These climate-associated effects impacting food availability and survival rates in common wintering grounds represent the main threat to declining populations.

Breeding populations in Svalbard, East Greenland, and northern Norway are currently declining, with climate change and its indirect effects identified as the most likely pressures driving negative trends. Between the late 1990s and 2020, all monitored populations have been significantly and synchronously declining at rates of 2-5% per annum, with some populations potentially facing extirpation within 40-50 years. Populations in East Greenland, Jan Mayen, northern Norway, West Spitsbergen, Bjørnøya, and along the Russian mainland coast are decreasing, with some facing potential extinction.

The species' life-history characteristics - being long-lived with slow reproduction - make populations particularly vulnerable to climate impacts and likely to recover slowly from reductions. Changes may have occurred in demographic parameters such as juvenile survival or breeding probability beyond the measured breeding success and adult survival indicators.

However, determining future climate change impacts remains challenging, particularly during non-breeding seasons when birds are distributed over large offshore areas.

An in-depth understanding of how climate change affects BRGU population status is needed, yet determining future impacts of climate change and its consequences on BRGU populations remains challenging, particularly during the non-breeding season when birds are distributed over large offshore areas. This uncertainty results in medium confidence in threat assessments despite high confidence in status assessments based on current quantitative data.

The future effects of climate change and its indirect consequences, such as lower food availability, are difficult to assess. This assessment challenge is compounded by fundamental monitoring gaps - population monitoring data are lacking or insufficient for important breeding populations within the Northeast Atlantic region, including East Greenland, Novaya Zemlya and Franz Josef Land. On Novaya Zemlya, no population trend data are available since the mid-1990s. In East Svalbard, only one colony is monitored annually.

Additional demographic parameter gaps exist beyond the current indicators of breeding success and adult survival, which provide only partial insights regarding BRGU condition. Changes may have occurred in other demographic parameters such as juvenile survival or breeding probability that remain unmeasured. Data are particularly scarce for populations in Greenland and Russia. More contaminant monitoring efforts are also needed following recent research reporting high mercury levels in some BRGU populations. These knowledge gaps significantly limit the ability to fully understand and predict climate change impacts on this species.",4,"Climate change represents the primary threat to Brünnich's guillemot (BRGU) populations in the Northeast Atlantic, with climate-related oceanographic shifts in wintering grounds causing ocean warming that has reduced food supplies and decreased survival and recruitment rates.

Key research needs identified include developing an in-depth understanding of how climate change affects BRGU population status. However, assessing future climate change effects and indirect consequences such as lower food availability remains difficult, particularly during non-breeding seasons when birds are distributed over large offshore areas.

Recommended measures include minimizing anthropogenic effects due to BRGU life-history characteristics (long-lived, slowly reproducing) that result in slow population recovery from reductions. Special focus should target declining, red-listed populations in West Svalbard, Jan Mayen, northern Norway, and East Greenland. Implementation of marine conservation areas for key foraging or overwintering areas is recommended as a future measure.

Additional research gaps requiring investigation include insufficient population monitoring data for important breeding populations in East Greenland, Novaya Zemlya, and Franz Josef Land.

The document addresses various environmental pressures affecting these seabird populations, including climate change and ocean warming effects, chemical pollution (particularly mercury contamination), oil pollution, hunting pressures, and habitat disturbance. While climate change is identified as the primary threat - specifically through oceanographic shifts associated with ocean warming that reduce food supplies and survival rates - ocean acidification is not mentioned as a pressure, threat, or research gap anywhere in the assessment.

The climate-related impacts discussed focus on warming-induced changes to prey availability in wintering grounds rather than chemical changes to ocean pH.

The report discusses temporal trends in stock indicators, population recovery from fishing depletion, and management measures, but contains no discussion of climate change impacts, temperature trends, ocean warming, or any other climate-related factors affecting marine ecosystems or thornback ray populations specifically. The focus remains entirely on fisheries impacts, stock recovery patterns, and species conservation status based on ICES stock assessments from survey data.",1,"Based on the provided context, there is no specific information about threats or pressures related to climate change for thornback rays. The OSPAR report focuses exclusively on two main pressure categories: fishing pressure and habitat damage.

The assessment identifies fishing pressure as the primary historical threat, noting that thornback rays were depleted by fisheries in most of Region II, where their distribution area contracted significantly. While fishing pressure has decreased from the beginning of the 21st century, bycatch remains problematic and requires more effective mitigation measures. The species' moderate biological productivity means recovery from depletion is slow, and threats are still present.

Habitat damage is listed as the second key pressure category, though specific details about habitat-related impacts are not elaborated in the provided context.

The report emphasizes that like all elasmobranchs, thornback rays are vulnerable to fishing mortality. Current management focuses on fishing regulations through Group-TACs in EU waters and the need for improved bycatch mitigation strategies.

The context consists entirely of a 2021 status assessment for thornback ray (a marine fish species) from OSPAR reports, focusing on fishing pressures, population trends, distribution, and management measures.

The context reveals that thornback rays were listed as threatened/declining in 2006 due to fisheries depletion in Region II, where distribution areas contracted significantly. Biomass indices and stock size indicators are now increasing in OSPAR Regions II and III, stable or increasing in Region IV, and stable at low levels around the Azores archipelago in Region V. However, recovery from depletion remains slow due to the species' moderate biological productivity and life-history traits that make it vulnerable to fishing mortality.

The assessment identifies fishing pressure and habitat damage as key threats, with bycatch remaining problematic despite general decreases in fishing effort since the early 21st century. The species occurs across varied benthic substrates from 10-200m depth, with outer estuaries and shallow bays serving as crucial spawning grounds and nurseries.

Substantial knowledge gaps exist regarding spawning areas, nursery locations outside UK coastal waters, and population structure, limiting effective spatial management. The status assessment shows positive trends but with considerable uncertainty around stock estimates, as indicative improvements are relatively recent (5-10 years).

The document is a species assessment report focused on thornback ray populations and does not address climate change impacts or related knowledge gaps.

The context does identify several significant knowledge gaps for thornback ray management and conservation: A substantial lack of knowledge remains on spawning and nursery areas for thornback rays outside the Thames estuary and other UK coastal areas, as well as on population structure. Population size is unknown and information on life history and population structure is incomplete. There is considerable uncertainty around stock size estimates and biomass indices in some areas, with knowledge of thornback ray populations remaining somewhat inconclusive. Species misidentification concerns exist, particularly between thornback ray and starry ray in survey data, which would underestimate thornback ray abundance.

These knowledge gaps limit the development of spatio-temporal management measures for the species. The report recommends tagging programmes, DNA analyses, and further investigation of existing survey data to identify nursery grounds and juvenile habitats. Measures for more effective bycatch mitigation still need development, and research on gear selectivity and thornback ray survival requires advancement.

However, none of these identified gaps relate to climate change impacts, climate adaptation, or climate-related research needs. The assessment focuses entirely on fisheries impacts, population dynamics, and traditional marine conservation concerns without addressing climate change considerations.",1,"The provided context does not contain any recommendations specifically related to climate change. This OSPAR report focuses exclusively on the status assessment of thornback ray, addressing fishing pressures, population dynamics, and species conservation measures.

The recommendations present in the context relate entirely to fisheries management and species research needs. Substantial knowledge gaps exist regarding spawning and nursery areas for thornback rays outside the Thames estuary and UK coastal areas, as well as population structure throughout their range. Electronic and conventional tagging programmes and DNA analyses focusing on thornback rays should be considered to address these gaps.

Existing survey data could provide information on nursery ground locations and juvenile habitats, which require further investigation to identify sites with large numbers of 0-groups (fish in their first year) where these life-history stages occur regularly. Research on increasing avoidance, gear selectivity and thornback ray survival needs advancement, with appropriate management measures developed accordingly.

Bycatch remains problematic despite improvements in the Northeast Atlantic from the early 21st century, requiring development of more effective bycatch mitigation measures. The Working Group on Elasmobranch Fishes remains concerned about potential misidentification of skates in recent surveys, particularly differentiation between thornback rays and starry rays, which could underestimate thornback ray abundance.

All other assessments,Waste water,No medata/ pdf,Waste water.pdf,Feeder report,1,"Climate change poses several significant threats to wastewater treatment systems and marine water quality. Extreme weather events linked to climate change are bringing heavier and more frequent rainfall in some areas while causing water scarcity in others, directly affecting how well storm sewers and treatment plants operate.

In regions experiencing increased heavy rainfall, urban areas with combined sewers face particular challenges. Rain enters these networks faster than they were designed to handle, causing overloading that leads to surface water flooding and overflow at urban wastewater treatment plants. This results in untreated sewage flowing directly into rivers, lakes, and coastal areas. Storm water overflows already place significant pressure on surface water bodies, and with more heavy rainfall events expected in the future, they will become an increasingly important source of pollution.

Treatment plants are more regularly being bypassed due to increasing storm surges, allowing raw effluent to enter water bodies. Many treatment plants are unable to operate fully after heavy rainfall, and storm surges frequently occur, permitting raw effluent to enter the water system.

Urban wastewater treatment now faces the challenge of addressing climate change alongside changes in population and newly emerging pollutants. The aquatic environment must deal with mixtures of chemicals from multiple sources, including pollutants from stormwaters, which contribute to the ""cocktail effect"" that may be impacting aquatic life. These climate-related pressures compound existing pollution challenges, making effective wastewater treatment more complex and critical for protecting marine environments.",5,"Climate change impacts species, habitats and ecosystems primarily through extreme weather events that alter pollution patterns and chemical exposure in aquatic environments. Extreme weather events linked to climate change bring heavier and more frequent rainfall in some areas, but water scarcity in others, affecting how storm sewers and treatment plants operate. Heavy rainfall events cause storm water overflows that place significant pressure on surface water bodies, and these will be an increasingly important source of pollution as more heavy rainfall events are expected in the future.

Increasing storm surges mean that treatment plants are more regularly by-passed, allowing raw effluent to enter water bodies. This results in damaging impacts in the marine environment through emissions of nutrients, hazardous chemicals including oestrogens and antibiotics, and microplastics. High nitrate concentrations cause eutrophication, increased plant growth, problem algal blooms, loss of life in bottom water and undesirable disturbance to the balance of organisms present in the water.

Chemical pollutants impact freshwater organisms and plants by altering reproduction rates, increasing species mortality, and changing the characteristics of entire local ecosystems. Many compounds are very toxic to algae, molluscs, crustaceans and fish, and have been identified as endocrine disruptors. These compounds can bioaccumulate in marine animals, resulting in potential impacts throughout the food chain, and cause oxygen depletion in water, negatively impacting the health of relevant species. The first example of endocrine disruption caused a catastrophic decline in and even local extinction of many mollusc populations in various parts of the world.",4,"Based on the OSPAR report context, several significant gaps are identified in relation to climate change impacts on wastewater treatment systems.

Urban wastewater treatment faces new challenges from climate change that existing infrastructure was not designed to handle. Extreme weather events are bringing heavier and more frequent rainfall in some areas while causing water scarcity in others, affecting how well storm sewers and treatment plants operate. Combined sewer systems are particularly vulnerable - when heavy rainfall occurs, rainwater enters the network faster than it was designed for, causing overloading that leads to surface water flooding and overflow at treatment plants, with untreated sewage flowing into rivers, lakes, or coastal areas.

Storm water overflows place significant pressure on surface water bodies, and with more heavy rainfall events expected in the future, they will become an increasingly important source of pollution. Many treatment plants are unable to operate fully after heavy rainfall, and increasing storm surges mean treatment plants are more regularly bypassed, allowing raw effluent to enter water bodies.

There are substantial knowledge gaps regarding antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Urban wastewater treatment plants could be increasing the transfer of AMR genes to the environment, but there is very limited information on the pathways for AMR in the environment to reach pathogens and human microbiome, and the significance of this transfer remains unclear.

Financial gaps compound these challenges. Current spending in many member states has been found too low to reach and maintain long-term compliance with wastewater treatment directives. The OECD estimates EU countries need an additional €253 billion between 2020 and 2030 to reach full compliance, while finance and planning remain the main challenges facing the water service sector.",5,"The OSPAR report identifies several critical climate change recommendations and research needs related to urban wastewater treatment systems.

**Primary Recommendations:**

Climate change necessitates upgrading urban wastewater treatment to address extreme weather events bringing heavier and more frequent rainfall in some areas, but water scarcity in others, affecting storm sewer and treatment plant operations. Storm water overflows place significant pressure on surface water bodies, and with more heavy rainfall events expected, they will become an increasingly important pollution source.

Sustainable urban drainage systems that allow rainwater absorption through carefully designed vegetation buffers provide solutions for managing runoff sustainably. These systems address the problem where combined sewers receive rainwater faster than designed capacity, causing network overloading, surface water flooding, and overflow at treatment plants with untreated sewage flowing into rivers, lakes, or coastal areas.

**Areas Requiring Investigation:**

The European Commission's impact assessment will evaluate policy measures to better deal with storm water overflows and urban runoff, including discharges from small agglomerations and poorly managed individual systems. Research needs include developing better planning for infrastructure investments and updating monitoring, reporting, and public information requirements to reflect technological progress.

**Emerging Climate-Related Issues:**

Increasing storm surges mean treatment plants are more regularly bypassed, allowing raw effluent to enter water bodies. Climate change compounds existing challenges with newly emerging pollutants, microplastics, and chemical mixtures requiring integrated assessment approaches.

OSPAR should encourage development of assessment schemes addressing combined effects and mixture toxicity, as current single-substance approaches inadequately address the complexity of multiple simultaneous chemical exposures in marine environments under changing climate conditions.",5,"The provided context does not contain any information about ocean acidification. The OSPAR report focuses entirely on waste water treatment and chemical pollution impacts on marine environments, but does not address ocean acidification as a topic.

The context extensively covers chemical contaminants and their effects on marine life, including hazardous substances that bioaccumulate in marine animals and impact growth and reproduction of aquatic species. Heavy metals from industrial sources have decreased in recent years, while eco-toxic loading from chemicals and energy supply remain significant contributors to water contamination. The aquatic environment faces complex mixtures of hundreds of chemicals simultaneously - the ""cocktail effect"" - with growing concern over pharmaceuticals, antibiotics, and contraceptives that impact aquatic life at low concentrations.

Microplastics are ubiquitous in marine ecosystems, accumulating in zooplankton, river-bed organisms, and mussels, causing gut blockage and starvation. Nutrient pollution causes eutrophication, algal blooms, and oxygen depletion in bottom waters. Industrial point sources contribute to eco-toxicity, though regulation has reduced direct releases of heavy metals and chlorinated organic substances.

The first documented case of endocrine disruption caused catastrophic decline and local extinction of mollusc populations globally. OSPAR maintains lists of priority chemicals and substances of concern, with monitoring strategies for each, working toward cessation of hazardous substance discharges.

However, none of this content addresses ocean acidification, its causes, impacts, or trends. The report's scope is limited to waste water pollution and chemical contamination effects rather than climate-related ocean chemistry changes.",1,"The provided context does not contain information about ocean acidification impacts on species, habitats, and ecosystems. The document focuses exclusively on wastewater impacts in the marine environment from domestic, commercial, and industrial sources.

The context details impacts from various pollutants including hazardous chemicals, nutrients, heavy metals, microplastics, and pharmaceuticals. Heavy metals are toxic to algae, molluscs, crustaceans, and fish, and can bioaccumulate in marine animals with potential impacts throughout food chains. High nitrate concentrations cause eutrophication, increased plant growth, problematic algal blooms, and loss of life in bottom waters. Chlorides impact freshwater organisms and plants by altering reproduction rates, increasing species mortality, and changing characteristics. Some compounds cause oxygen depletion in water, negatively impacting species health.

Microplastics accumulate in the intestinal tract of zooplankton, river-bed organisms, and mussels, causing gut blockage and starvation. Chemical endocrine disruption caused catastrophic decline and local extinction of many mollusc populations worldwide. Pharmaceuticals including antibiotics and contraceptives impact aquatic life, with growing evidence of these effects. The aquatic environment faces complex mixtures of chemicals creating ""cocktail effects"" that may impact aquatic life, though the challenge remains determining which substances are most important for mixture toxicity.

Temperature increases are among the main causes for decline in Zostera bed condition. Natural factors linked to climate impacts include severe storms, increased seawater temperatures, and exposure to air that cause changes in seagrass bed extent.

Climate change may drive expansion of Zostera beds to deeper, cooler waters and likely cause expansion of the northern distribution limit, potentially reaching areas like Greenland. Rising sea levels create additional pressures through increased needs for coastal protection, leading to greater risks for habitat loss and coastal squeeze, where the coastal zone in built-up areas becomes narrower.

These climate pressures necessitate reducing other stressors to facilitate adaptation, particularly eutrophication, trawling, and coastal development. Management must become ""climate ready"" to address these emerging challenges. Useful environmental indicators for monitoring climate impacts include climatic variables such as water temperature and storm frequency and intensity.

Climate change interacts with other human-induced threats, making it difficult to distinguish changes from natural variability versus human impacts. Most reported climate-related threats have been increasing across regions and are expected to continue increasing, emphasizing the urgency of comprehensive management approaches that address multiple stressors simultaneously.",4,"Climate change represents one of the harder-to-manage threats to Zostera beds, with emerging impacts that exacerbate overall stress on these marine habitats. Climate change causes coastal darkening and sediment resuspension, which compound existing pressures from eutrophication, trawling, and coastal development.

Specific climate-related threats include increased turbidity and reduced light penetration, which can be exacerbated by climate change in the future. Storm frequencies and intensities are expected to increase, leading to greater sediment resuspension that damages Zostera beds. Rising sea levels create coastal squeeze effects, where coastal zones in built-up areas become narrower, increasing habitat loss risks. Additionally, increased seawater temperatures directly threaten seagrass extent, while increased needs for coastal protection infrastructure due to climate change further elevate habitat loss risks.

Climate change may force adaptations in habitat management, potentially increasing the need to reduce other stressors to facilitate expansion of Zostera beds to deeper, cooler waters. However, climate change may also enable northward expansion of distribution limits, particularly toward areas like Greenland.

Natural climate-related factors contributing to seagrass bed changes include severe storms, exposure to air, freshwater pulses, and increased seawater temperatures. Climatic variables such as water temperature and storm frequency and intensity serve as useful environmental indicators for monitoring these habitats.

Most reported threats, including climate-related ones, have been increasing across most regions and are expected to continue increasing. The interaction of multiple climate and human pressures makes identifying specific causes of decline particularly challenging, emphasizing the need for climate-ready management approaches.",5,"Climate change impacts species, habitats and ecosystems through multiple interconnected mechanisms that exacerbate existing stressors and create new threats. Emerging climate impacts cause coastal darkening and sediment resuspension, which compound overall environmental stress on marine habitats like Zostera beds across all four OSPAR regions.

Temperature increases represent a direct threat, contributing to habitat decline alongside wasting disease, nutrient enrichment, and marine pollution. Climate change exacerbates threats including increased water turbidity, reduced light penetration, and sediment resuspension, which particularly affect light-dependent species like seagrasses. These impacts may necessitate expansion of Zostera beds to deeper, cooler waters as thermal refugia.

Storm frequency and intensity increases linked to climate change create additional physical disturbance, with patchy Zostera beds having less than 60% cover suffering greater storm-related losses than dense, stable beds. Rising sea levels contribute to coastal squeeze, narrowing coastal zones in built-up areas and increasing habitat loss risks as coastal development intensifies for protection purposes.

Climate change may trigger distribution shifts, potentially expanding northern distribution limits while causing contraction at trailing edges in southern regions like Portugal and Spain. Natural climate-related factors including severe storms, freshwater pulses, and increased seawater temperatures alter habitat extent, though distinguishing these from human-induced changes remains challenging.

The interaction of multiple climate-related stressors with existing pressures like eutrophication, trawling, and coastal development creates cumulative impacts that are poorly understood but increasingly recognized as critical management challenges requiring ""climate ready"" approaches.",4,"Regarding climate change gaps, the report identifies several critical knowledge and research needs. There is a general lack of knowledge about how different pressures may interact to disturb and damage Zostera beds, making it difficult to separate changes following human-induced threats from those related to natural climate variability. This distinction between anthropogenic and natural climate impacts remains poorly understood.

Specific climate-related research gaps include insufficient studies of changes in Zostera beds due to climate change effects such as increased turbidity, reduced light penetration, and sediment resuspension from increased storm frequencies and intensities. The report notes that coastal darkening and sediment resuspension from climate change are emerging impacts that exacerbate overall stress on eelgrass beds, but understanding of these processes appears limited.

Climate change threatens to increase turbidity and sediment resuspension, which may necessitate further reduction of other stressors to facilitate Zostera expansion to deeper, cooler waters. However, the report indicates insufficient research on these adaptive management approaches. Additionally, there are gaps in understanding how climate change may affect the northern distribution limits of eelgrass, with only limited evidence of potential expansion to areas like Greenland.

The report identifies needs for management to become ""climate ready,"" particularly regarding coastal squeeze - where rising sea levels narrow coastal zones in built-up areas, increasing habitat loss risks. However, comprehensive strategies for climate adaptation appear underdeveloped.

Monitoring programs currently include climatic variables like water temperature and storm frequency as indicators, but systematic assessment of climate impacts remains patchy across regions. Historical baseline data are missing from most countries, hampering assessment of long-term climate-related changes versus natural variability.",5,"Management must become ""climate ready"" to address emerging climate change impacts on Zostera beds. Climate change exacerbates stress through coastal darkening, sediment resuspension, increased turbidity, reduced light penetration, and more frequent intense storms. Rising sea levels increase coastal protection needs, leading to habitat loss and coastal squeeze where built-up coastal zones become narrower.

Climate change may force Zostera beds to expand to deeper, cooler waters, requiring reduction of other stressors to facilitate this migration. Conversely, climate change may enable expansion of northern distribution limits, such as in Greenland. Natural climate-related factors like severe storms, increased seawater temperatures, and freshwater pulses already affect seagrass extent, making it difficult to distinguish human-induced from natural changes.

Several research priorities require investigation. Studies examining climate change effects on Zostera beds are needed, particularly regarding increased turbidity, light penetration changes, and storm-related resuspension. The functional aspects of eelgrass beds, including their coastal protection capabilities and biodiversity functions, deserve more attention. More scientific studies should assess ecosystem functions including habitat provision, biodiversity stimulation, and carbon sequestration.

Monitoring programs should include climatic variables such as water temperature and storm frequency/intensity as useful environmental indicators. However, significant data and knowledge gaps exist, particularly in Regions I and IV, with generally lacking eelgrass maps and baseline data. Understanding how different pressures interact remains limited. The interaction of multiple pressures makes identifying specific causes of loss difficult, emphasizing the need to manage other stressors like eutrophication, trawling, and coastal development alongside climate adaptation measures.",4,"The provided context does not specifically address ocean acidification in relation to Zostera beds or seagrass habitats. The OSPAR report focuses extensively on other threats and pressures affecting seagrass ecosystems, but ocean acidification is not explicitly mentioned as a factor.

The document identifies multiple pressures causing decline in Zostera bed condition, including wasting-disease, nutrient enrichment, marine pollution, reduced water quality, temperature increases, and destruction from anthropogenic activities such as construction work, mooring, anchoring, and fisheries. Climate change impacts are discussed in terms of coastal darkening, sediment resuspension, increased turbidity, reduced light penetration, increased storm frequencies and intensities, and rising sea levels leading to coastal squeeze.

The report notes that threats such as increased turbidity and sediment resuspension can be exacerbated by climate change, and that climate change may increase the need to reduce other stressors to facilitate expansion of Zostera beds to deeper, cooler waters. Temperature increases are specifically mentioned as contributing to habitat decline, and useful environmental indicators include water temperature and storm frequency and intensity.

Most reported threats have been increasing across OSPAR regions and are expected to continue increasing. The document emphasizes that emerging climate change impacts exacerbate overall stress on Zostera beds, highlighting the need to manage other stressors like eutrophication, trawling, and coastal development. However, ocean acidification is not identified among the climate-related stressors affecting these marine habitats in this particular assessment.",1,"The provided context does not contain any information about ocean acidification or its impacts on species, habitats, and ecosystems. The entire document focuses exclusively on Zostera beds (seagrass habitats) within the OSPAR Maritime Area and their status, threats, and management.

The context reveals that Zostera beds are in poor overall status across all four OSPAR regions due to multiple pressures and threats, but ocean acidification is not mentioned among these threats. The documented threats to seagrass ecosystems include wasting disease, nutrient enrichment, marine pollution, reduced water quality and light climate, physical destruction from anthropogenic activities such as construction work, mooring, anchoring, and fisheries. Climate change impacts are mentioned in terms of temperature increases, increased turbidity, reduced light penetration, sediment resuspension, coastal darkening, and increased storm frequencies and intensities, but ocean acidification specifically is not addressed.

The document extensively covers the ecological significance of Zostera beds, noting their association with species like Atlantic cod and European eel, and their importance for biodiversity and coastal protection. However, none of this information relates to ocean acidification effects.

To answer the question about ocean acidification impacts on marine species, habitats, and ecosystems, different source material would be required that specifically addresses ocean chemistry changes, pH levels, carbonate saturation states, and their biological consequences.",1,8,0,8
All indicator assessments,Changes in average trophic level of marine consumers,OK,fw4_average_trophic_level_marine_consumers_qsr2023.pdf,"Climate change is mentioned only briefly in this OSPAR report as one of several anthropogenic pressures affecting marine ecosystems. The report identifies climate change as a factor that can cause declining indicator states or be linked to increasing impacts on marine systems, alongside other anthropogenic pressures.

The document focuses primarily on analyzing changes in Mean Trophic Level (MTL) across different marine ecosystems in the OSPAR Maritime Area from 2000-2021. Environmental and human-induced pressures, including climate change, can trigger changes in prey availability and predator selectivity, causing variability in trophic level values across space and time. Marine ecosystem functioning depends on structure, diversity and integrity, which are subjected to many environmental and anthropogenic pressures that cause alterations at high, intermediate and low trophic levels.

The assessment reveals mixed trends across different regions and depth zones. In Portuguese waters, significant decreases of top predators occurred in shelf ecosystems when including pelagic species. French coastal and shelf areas showed increasing trends for top predators, while the Gulf of Cadiz displayed signs of recovery in shelf and deep ecosystems at all trophic levels. These contrasting patterns - with mostly negative trends at one trophic level and positive trends at another - were observed consistently across small scales.

However, the report does not provide specific data on climate change impacts, mechanisms, or projected effects on marine ecosystems. The analysis focuses on documenting trophic level changes and food web dynamics rather than attributing these changes to specific drivers like climate change versus fishing pressure or other anthropogenic factors.",2,"The OSPAR report identifies climate change as one of the anthropogenic pressures that can negatively impact marine ecosystem indicators. Specifically, when indicator changes are linked to increasing impacts of anthropogenic pressures including climate change, this triggers a classification indicating declining environmental state or unsatisfactory conditions.

The report establishes that marine ecosystem functioning depends on structure, diversity and integrity, which are subjected to many environmental and anthropogenic pressures causing alterations across all trophic levels - from high to intermediate to low. Climate change is explicitly identified as one of these pressures alongside others affecting marine food webs.

Environmental and human-induced pressures, which would include climate change effects, can trigger changes in prey availability and predator selectivity. This causes variability in trophic level values for species across space and time, and even during different life stages. These pressure-induced changes affect the fundamental consumer-resource interactions that form the basis of marine food web structure.

The assessment framework treats climate change impacts as a key concern for ecosystem resilience. The report references the need to strengthen marine ecosystem resilience to avoid significant adverse impacts, specifically mentioning climate change and ocean acidification as pressures requiring sustainable management responses.

The Mean Trophic Level indicator being assessed can detect when ecosystems are experiencing increasing anthropogenic pressures including climate change, with such changes classified as representing declining states. This suggests climate change effects are manifesting in measurable ways within marine food web structures across the OSPAR Maritime Area, though the report focuses primarily on fishing pressure impacts rather than providing detailed climate change-specific findings or quantitative data on climate-related ecosystem changes.",4,"Based on the provided context, climate change impacts on marine ecosystems are identified as one of the anthropogenic pressures causing significant changes to species and ecosystem structure. 

Climate change is specifically linked to declining states in marine ecosystems, with indicator changes connected to increasing impacts of anthropogenic pressures including climate change representing deteriorating conditions. Marine ecosystem functioning strongly depends on structure, diversity and integrity, all of which are subjected to environmental and anthropogenic pressures that cause alterations across high, intermediate and low trophic levels.

The context reveals complex ecosystem responses across different regions and depth zones. In slope ecosystems, mostly decreasing trends are observed in community-level indicators, while shelf ecosystems show mostly increasing trends. The French continental shelf demonstrates overall increases in top predators in coastal and shelf ecosystems, contrasting with decreases generally observed in North Iberian and Portuguese waters. However, the Gulf of Cadiz shows signs of recovery in shelf and deep-sea ecosystems.

Environmental and human-induced pressures, including climate change, trigger changes in prey availability and predator selectivity, causing variability in trophic level values for species across space and time. These pressures force alterations in energy transfer pathways from primary producers to top predators through food webs.

Some ecosystems demonstrate high resilience, with non-significant trends potentially indicating systems enduring high and sustained impacts rather than absence of effects. The context indicates that highly impacted ecosystems might become so resilient that lack of trends actually represents resilience rather than stability.

However, the provided context primarily focuses on trophic level indicators and fisheries data rather than direct climate change mechanisms, limiting the comprehensiveness of climate impact assessment.",4,"The OSPAR report identifies several key knowledge gaps related to climate change impacts on marine ecosystems. Climate change is recognized as one of the anthropogenic pressures that can trigger changes in indicator states, particularly when indicators show declining trends or remain unchanged in unsatisfactory conditions.

The most significant gap involves insufficient comprehensive datasets on feeding ecology of key marine species, especially those at lower trophic levels. This limitation hampers assessment of how climate change affects food web structure and connectivity. Environmental pressures, including climate-induced changes, can alter prey availability and predator selectivity, causing variability in trophic level values across space, time, and species development stages.

Data collection gaps include lack of biomass data on benthos and invertebrates, which limits calculation of community-wide indicators. The report emphasizes need for extended data collection on feeding ecology by sub-division to fill knowledge gaps in food web structure. Repeat dietary analyses and stable isotope studies implemented at sub-regional scales would help address these deficiencies.

Methodological gaps include need to incorporate interannual variability of species trophic levels and investigate influence of various anthropogenic pressures (including climate change) on ecosystem indicators. Assessment criteria require improvement through defining thresholds using pressure-state curves.

The report notes that highly impacted ecosystems may become so resilient that lack of trends actually indicates system resilience rather than absence of impact. This presents a challenge for detecting climate change effects in already-stressed marine systems. Spatial and temporal variability in trophic relationships requires better understanding to accurately determine how climate pressures affect ecosystem functioning across different bathymetric and ecological scenarios.",4,"Based on the provided context, the recommendations regarding climate change are limited but specific. The report identifies climate change as one of the anthropogenic pressures causing declining states in marine indicators, with indicator changes linked to increasing impacts of anthropogenic pressures including climate change being classified as problematic conditions requiring attention.

The primary recommendation involves investigating the influence of various anthropogenic pressures, including climate change, on the Mean Trophic Level (MTL) indicator. This represents a key research priority for understanding how climate change affects marine food web structure and functioning.

Several research gaps requiring investigation emerge from the analysis. Environmental or human-induced pressures, which include climate impacts, trigger changes in prey availability and predator selectivity, causing variability in trophic level values for species across space and time. The report emphasizes the need for repeated dietary studies and stable isotope analyses implemented at sub-regional scale to understand these pressure-induced changes in trophic relationships.

Critical research requirements include systematic collection of species feeding habits data and their variations with ontogeny, comprehensive datasets on feeding ecology of key marine species, and extending data collection on feeding ecology by sub-division to understand how environmental pressures affect local trophic interactions.

The assessment methodology should incorporate interannual variability of species trophic levels and variations of trophic level with size to capture climate-induced changes. Defining thresholds using pressure-state curves is recommended to improve assessment criteria for detecting climate change impacts on marine ecosystems.

The context emphasizes that marine ecosystem functioning depends on structure, diversity and integrity, which are subjected to environmental and anthropogenic pressures causing alterations across all trophic levels, making comprehensive pressure-state relationship research essential for climate change impact assessment.",4,"The provided context contains extremely limited information about ocean acidification. Ocean acidification is mentioned only twice in brief organizational statements about creating a North-East Atlantic Ocean that is ""resilient to climate change and ocean acidification.""

The document does not provide any scientific findings, data, measurements, or analysis specifically related to ocean acidification. Instead, the entire context focuses exclusively on changes in marine trophic levels - examining how the average trophic level of marine consumers has changed across different OSPAR sub-divisions, depth strata, and time periods from 2000-2021.

The context discusses marine ecosystem functioning, food web structures, fishing pressures, and trophic level indicators, but contains no information about pH levels, carbonic acid concentrations, impacts on shell-forming organisms, coral reefs, or any other aspects typically associated with ocean acidification research.

While the document acknowledges that marine ecosystems are ""subjected to many environmental and anthropogenic pressures that cause alterations on ecosystem components at high, intermediate and low trophic levels,"" and mentions that indicator changes may be ""linked to increasing impact of anthropogenic pressures (including climate change),"" it does not specifically identify or analyze ocean acidification as one of these pressures or discuss its effects on the trophic level changes observed.

The context is insufficient to provide any substantive information about ocean acidification beyond acknowledging it as a challenge requiring ecosystem resilience.",1,"The provided context does not address ocean acidification's impacts on species, habitats and ecosystems. The context focuses exclusively on marine trophic level (MTL) analyses examining changes in food web structure across different depths and regions in the North-East Atlantic from 2000-2021.

The context analyzes trends in mean trophic levels of marine consumers including benthic invertebrates, cephalopods, elasmobranchs, and fish across coastal (<30m), shelf (30-200m), and deep (>200m) ecosystems in four OSPAR sub-divisions. Key findings include decreasing trends in top predators in North Iberian and Portuguese waters, while French continental shelf showed signs of recovery. Slope ecosystems displayed mostly decreasing MTL trends while shelf ecosystems showed increasing trends. The Gulf of Cadiz demonstrated recovery signs in shelf and deep-sea ecosystems.

The analyses reveal that marine ecosystem functioning depends on structure, diversity and integrity, which are subject to environmental and anthropogenic pressures causing alterations across all trophic levels. Energy transfers from lower to higher trophic levels through food web interconnections, with declining biomass of high trophic level species forcing fisheries to target lower trophic levels.

While ocean acidification is briefly mentioned once as a pressure that ecosystems should be resilient to, no specific impacts, mechanisms, or effects of ocean acidification on marine species, habitats, or ecosystems are described in the provided context.

All indicator assessments,Changes in phytoplankton and zooplankton communities,OK,ph1fw5_phytoplankton_zooplankton_communities_qsr2023.pdf,"Climate change is identified as a major driver of observed changes in plankton communities across the North-East Atlantic. The assessment reveals that atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, the main driver of global warming, directly affects marine pH levels, which in turn impacts phytoplankton communities that ingest Dissolved Inorganic Carbon for growth and reproduction.

Rising sea surface temperatures show strong correlations with widespread plankton abundance changes. Meroplankton in coastal and shelf areas are increasing in abundance, with these trends closely linked to rising temperatures. Conversely, declining abundance trends in dinoflagellates, large copepods, and small copepods in coastal habitats are directly linked to temperature increases. In the Atlantic region, increased sea surface temperatures are particularly associated with declining abundances of small and large copepods. Temperature impacts are most frequently detected in shelf and oceanic pelagic habitats.

Increasing temperatures also drive indirect effects through greater water column stratification and resulting nutrient limitation. In shelf areas, holoplankton abundance declines are linked to both temperature increases and decreasing pH levels, demonstrating multiple climate-related stressors operating simultaneously.

The assessment identifies ocean acidification as another climate-driven pressure, with declining pH linked to reduced holoplankton abundance in coastal areas. Changes in pH affect primary production dynamics and are connected to atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations.

Climate change influences both external environmental pressures (precipitation, wind speed) and internal marine conditions (pH, water temperature). The 2017 assessment noted that robust conclusions required additional investigation into climate change impacts on plankton communities, which this analysis addresses by establishing clear links between climatic variables and long-term ecosystem changes.",5,"Climate change-related threats and pressures are manifesting through multiple interconnected pathways affecting plankton communities across the North-East Atlantic. Increased sea surface temperatures represent the primary climate pressure, directly linked to declining abundances of plankton lifeforms, particularly small and large copepods in the Atlantic. Temperature impacts were most frequently detected in shelf and oceanic pelagic habitats, with increasing temperatures also strongly linked to rising meroplankton abundance within the Eastern North Sea.

Beyond direct thermal effects, rising temperatures drive greater water column stratification, resulting in nutrient limitation that further impacts plankton communities. Ocean acidification, driven by atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, creates additional stress through decreasing pH levels. Declining holoplankton abundance in coastal areas has been linked to these pH reductions. Changes in pH affect primary production since phytoplankton require Dissolved Inorganic Carbon for growth and reproduction.

The assessment reveals that environmental pressures acting both externally (precipitation, wind speed) and internally (pH, water temperature) on marine environments are being influenced indirectly by climate change. Declining abundance trends in dinoflagellates and both large and small copepods in coastal habitats were specifically linked to temperature increases, while similar temperature-driven declines occurred in shelf and oceanic habitats.

These climate-driven changes have cascading effects through marine food webs, with plankton community responses potentially affecting higher trophic levels including shellfish, fish, and seabirds. The assessment identifies knowledge gaps requiring further research to explore direct mechanistic links between environmental variables and lifeform abundance changes, and to examine national datasets at finer spatiotemporal scales to establish clearer connections between climatic pressures and pelagic habitat changes.",5,"Climate change impacts marine ecosystems through multiple mechanisms that primarily affect plankton communities, which form the foundation of marine food webs. Increased sea surface temperatures drive declining abundances of most plankton lifeforms, particularly small and large copepods in the Atlantic region. Temperature increases were most frequently detected in shelf and oceanic pelagic habitats, with holoplankton, large and small copepods in shelf areas exhibiting decreasing abundance trends linked to rising temperatures.

Rising temperatures create additional stress through enhanced water column stratification, resulting in nutrient limitation that further impacts plankton populations. Changes in environmental pressures acting externally (precipitation, wind speed) and internally (pH, water temperature) on marine environments are influenced indirectly by climate change. Ocean acidification, reflected in decreasing pH levels, contributes to declining holoplankton abundance in coastal areas and affects primary production by altering phytoplankton carbon uptake processes.

Most plankton lifeforms, including diatoms, dinoflagellates, holoplankton, fish larvae/eggs, and copepods, are declining in abundance throughout the North-East Atlantic. These changes cascade through marine food webs because plankton support shellfish, fish, and seabirds either directly or indirectly. Short-term changes in plankton abundance create immediate consequences for higher trophic levels, while gradual changes over decades indicate long-term shifts in ecosystem functioning, including energy transfer from primary to secondary producers and pathways of energy flow to top predators. The assessment reveals widespread ecosystem impacts, with declining abundance trends linked to temperature increases observed across coastal, shelf, and oceanic habitats.",4,"The OSPAR report identifies several critical knowledge gaps specifically related to climate change research in plankton communities. Most significantly, further scientific research is required to explore direct mechanistic links between change in environmental variables and change in lifeform abundance. This represents a fundamental gap in understanding how climate drivers directly affect plankton populations.

The assessment reveals that while 78% of the 182 significant trends in lifeform abundance could not be predicted by environmental variable models, many environmental pressures affecting plankton are influenced indirectly by climate change. The report notes that increased sea surface temperatures are linked to declining abundances of plankton lifeforms, particularly small and large copepods in the Atlantic, and to increasing meroplankton abundance in the Eastern North Sea. However, the mechanistic pathways remain unclear.

Data coverage presents another major gap. Zooplankton datasets are critically lacking within pelagic habitats, particularly for variable salinity habitats in the Greater North Sea and Celtic Seas, and coastal habitats in the Bay of Biscay and Iberian Coast. Both phytoplankton and zooplankton data are insufficient for variable salinity habitats in these regions.

The report identifies a need to examine national datasets at finer spatiotemporal scales to establish clearer links between climatic and anthropogenic pressures with changes in pelagic habitats and plankton diversity. Additionally, examining the ecological consequences of changing lifeform abundance on higher trophic levels could help link pelagic and food web assessments in terms of climate-related changes and impacts. The assessment acknowledges that five years is insufficient for robust environmental change assessment, highlighting temporal limitations in detecting climate-driven trends.",5,"Based on the provided context, the OSPAR report identifies several climate change-related recommendations and research priorities centered on plankton community monitoring and ecosystem resilience.

The assessment reveals that increased sea surface temperatures are linked to declining abundances of plankton lifeforms, particularly small and large copepods in the Atlantic, with temperature changes strongly connected to increasing meroplankton abundance in the Eastern North Sea. Climate-driven environmental pressures, including pH changes, water temperature variations, precipitation, and wind speed, significantly influence plankton community structure. Rising temperatures can cause direct impacts and lead to greater stratification with resulting nutrient limitation, affecting shelf and oceanic pelagic habitats most frequently.

The report recommends establishing monthly monitoring programmes for pico and nanoplankton, which represent a data-sparse component requiring better understanding of their biological interactions. Critical research needs include examining national datasets at finer spatiotemporal scales to establish clearer links between climatic and anthropogenic pressures with changes in pelagic habitats and plankton diversity.

Further investigation is required to explore direct mechanistic links between environmental variable changes and lifeform abundance changes. The assessment identifies the need to introduce lag effects into variable selection processes to test delayed environmental pressure impacts, such as winter nutrient concentrations affecting growing season abundance. Research should examine ecological consequences of changing lifeform abundance on higher trophic levels and investigate impacts of long-term abundance changes on pelagic food webs.

Additional zooplankton datasets are needed for underrepresented pelagic habitat types, particularly in variable salinity habitats across Greater North Sea, Celtic Seas, and Bay of Biscay regions. The report emphasizes that longer assessment periods increase detection of important plankton community changes due to high inter-annual variability and gradual rates of environmental change.",4,"Declining abundance of holoplankton in coastal areas has been linked to decreasing pH levels. pH changes connect to alterations in primary production because phytoplankton ingest Dissolved Inorganic Carbon (DIC) for growth and reproduction, with pH variations also tied to atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations - the primary driver of global warming.

In shelf areas, decreasing abundance of both holoplankton and dinoflagellates may be linked to pH reductions, alongside increases in the nitrogen-to-phosphorus (N:P) ratio. Changes in lifeform abundance were associated with environmental pressures acting internally on marine environments, including pH variations alongside water temperature.

The assessment methodology specifically identifies pH as one of three key environmental pressures (along with sea surface temperature and nutrients) that must be considered when evaluating plankton community changes. pH data is reported on the total scale using the European Regional Seas Ecosystem Model (ERSEM).

However, the analysis reveals significant limitations in understanding ocean acidification impacts. Of 182 significant trends in lifeform abundance assessed, 78% showed no statistically significant predictive ability from models based on environmental pressures, suggesting substantial gaps in linking pH changes to biological responses. The context indicates that additional scientific research is required to explore direct mechanistic links between environmental variable changes, including pH, and lifeform abundance variations. The assessment focuses primarily on correlative relationships rather than establishing causative mechanisms for ocean acidification effects on plankton communities.",4,"Ocean acidification impacts marine species and ecosystems through multiple interconnected pathways, primarily by altering plankton communities that form the base of marine food webs.

Decreasing pH directly affects holoplankton abundance in coastal areas, with declining trends observed across multiple regions. These changes in pH link to alterations in primary production because phytoplankton require Dissolved Inorganic Carbon (DIC) for growth and reproduction, but this process becomes disrupted as atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations increase - the primary driver of ocean acidification.

In shelf areas, decreasing abundance of both holoplankton and dinoflagellates connects to pH reductions. These pH-driven changes cascade through pelagic habitats, affecting the transfer of energy from primary to secondary producers and altering phytoplankton-zooplankton dynamics. Since plankton form the foundation of marine food webs, these disruptions propagate to higher trophic levels including shellfish, fish, and seabirds that depend directly or indirectly on plankton communities.

The impacts extend beyond individual species to ecosystem functioning. Changes in holoplankton affect benthic-pelagic coupling, as these fully planktonic organisms play crucial roles in energy transfer between water column and seafloor habitats. Acidification-induced changes in primary production alter fundamental aspects of ecosystem function, including energy flow pathways and food web structure.

Plankton communities serve as sensitive indicators of acidification impacts due to their short generational times, small size, and direct dependence on dissolved nutrients. Changes in their abundance patterns over time reveal spatial patterns of environmental change, with acidification effects most apparent in coastal regions where pH declines are pronounced. These foundational changes ultimately compromise marine ecosystem resilience and productivity across the North-East Atlantic.",4,7,2,16
All indicator assessments,Concentrations of dissolved oxygen near the seafloor,OK,dissolved_oxygen_qsr2023.pdf,"Climate change has serious effects on marine ecosystems, with oceanic dissolved oxygen concentrations declining by 2% between 1960 and 2010, though strong regional variations exist. As more carbon dioxide is released enhancing the greenhouse effect, much of the heat is absorbed by the oceans, and this warmer water can hold less oxygen due to reduced solubility.

Climate change impacts dissolved oxygen concentration through multiple pathways beyond direct solubility effects. It can increase water column stratification, which promotes phytoplankton growth above the thermocline that subsequently decays and consumes oxygen beneath it. Increased bottom water temperatures also enhance bacterial consumption, further drawing down oxygen levels. Regions with relatively small water volumes beneath the thermocline are most vulnerable to low oxygen conditions.

During future climate change, simultaneous shifts in temperature, CO₂, and hypoxia levels will enhance sensitivity to environmental extremes compared to changes in single variables. As temperatures rise above thermal optima, the oxygen threshold for hypoxia increases due to steep increases in respiratory demand.

Recent studies have focused on distinguishing between effects of nutrient enrichment versus seawater temperature changes from climate change. The complexity involves multiple interactions between physical and biological processes controlling near-bed oxygen dynamics. Only in the Atlantic Seasonally Stratified region was decreased solubility due to temperature the dominant factor in reduced oxygen concentrations.

Key knowledge gaps include understanding climate change impacts on hydrodynamic processes and oxygen deficiency. The relative importance of biological versus physical processes in controlling near-bed oxygen dynamics remains poorly understood. Improved understanding of climate change impacts requires further research, and robust assessments need better data availability.",4,"Climate change poses multiple significant threats and pressures to marine ecosystems through its impacts on dissolved oxygen levels and related processes. Global ocean dissolved oxygen concentrations declined by 2% between 1960 and 2010, with strong regional variations affecting marine systems.

Climate change impacts dissolved oxygen through several mechanisms. Increased atmospheric carbon dioxide enhances the greenhouse effect, with much heat absorbed by oceans. This warmer water holds less oxygen due to reduced solubility. Climate change also increases water column stratification, inhibiting the supply of oxygenated waters to deeper levels and creating conditions conducive to oxygen depletion in regions with relatively small water volumes beneath the thermocline.

Temperature increases promote phytoplankton growth above the thermocline, which when decomposing beneath the thermocline decreases oxygen concentrations. Increased bottom water temperatures enhance bacterial consumption, accelerating oxygen drawdown. Elevated CO2 levels directly promote phytoplankton growth, contributing to this cycle.

The combined effects of rising temperatures and hypoxia enhance marine organism sensitivity to environmental extremes compared to single variable changes. Experimental evidence shows that as temperatures rise above thermal optima, oxygen thresholds for hypoxia increase due to steep increases in respiratory demand.

Multiple regions show statistically significant negative dissolved oxygen trends, including the Atlantic Seasonally Stratified region where temperature-induced decreased solubility was the dominant factor. The Meuse Plume, Atlantic, Norwegian Trench, and Scheldt Plume areas all demonstrate declining trends even when temperature and salinity effects on oxygen solubility are accounted for.

Major knowledge gaps remain regarding climate change impacts on hydrodynamic processes, oxygen deficiency, and the complex interactions between physical and biological processes controlling oxygen dynamics.",5,"Climate change severely impacts marine species, habitats and ecosystems primarily through ocean warming and deoxygenation. Ocean dissolved oxygen concentrations declined by 2% between 1960 and 2010, with strong regional variations. As carbon dioxide enhances the greenhouse effect, oceans absorb much of this heat, and warmer water holds less oxygen than cooler water.

Climate change affects dissolved oxygen through multiple mechanisms. Warming increases water column stratification, inhibiting the supply of oxygenated surface waters to deeper levels. Increased CO2 concentrations promote phytoplankton growth above the thermocline, which when decaying beneath the thermocline decreases oxygen concentrations. Higher bottom water temperatures increase bacterial consumption, enhancing oxygen depletion. Experimental evidence shows that as temperatures rise above thermal optima, oxygen thresholds for hypoxia increase due to steep increases in respiratory demand.

These changes cause widespread ecosystem impacts. Hypoxic conditions (dissolved oxygen below 2mg/l) cause lethal and sub-lethal effects on benthic organisms and fish, leading to biodiversity loss. Oxygen depletion results in behavioral changes or death of fish and bottom fauna and flora. Negative effects on bottom fauna reduce food availability for fish, decreasing fish population productivity. In extremely low oxygen conditions, only bacteria can survive on the seafloor.

Climate-induced hypoxia has created dead zones affecting over 245,000km² of marine ecosystems worldwide. Multiple assessment areas show statistically significant decreasing oxygen trends, including river plumes, shelf areas, and oceanic regions. Understanding climate change impacts on hydrodynamic processes and oxygen deficiency remains a key knowledge gap requiring further research.",4,"The OSPAR report identifies several critical knowledge gaps specifically related to climate change impacts on marine oxygen systems. Key knowledge gaps include understanding the impacts of climate change on hydrodynamic processes and oxygen deficiency, with improved understanding requiring further research.

Understanding the relative importance of biological and physical processes (mixing and currents) in controlling near-bed oxygen dynamics presents complex challenges, with multiple interactions between physical and biological processes affecting how climate change impacts oxygen deficiency and consumption. Recent studies have focused on distinguishing between the effects of nutrient enrichment and changes in seawater temperature resulting from climate change, but significant gaps remain.

The report highlights methodological limitations in capturing climate change effects. Current methods may not detect very low dissolved oxygen concentrations, and better data collection using automated sampling devices supported by modelling is needed to capture high spatial and temporal variability. Assessment methods require development, including incorporating models that examine the number of days below oxygen thresholds.

Robust assessments of oxygen deficiency require improved data availability across many assessment areas. The Atlantic Seasonally Stratified region, comprising much of the Celtic Sea, has particularly poor observational coverage. Confidence assessments show assessment at grid scales is problematic due to numerous data gaps at smaller spatial scales.

Spatial coverage limitations are evident, with many available data points concentrated in nearshore waters, highlighting the importance of improved spatial coverage for confident marine area assessments. Data filtering requirements (depth, season, salinity) considerably reduce available datasets, emphasizing the need for targeted monitoring in future assessments to better understand climate change impacts on marine oxygen systems.",5,"OSPAR recommends several research priorities and methodological improvements to address climate change impacts on marine oxygen deficiency. Ocean dissolved oxygen concentrations declined by 2% between 1960 and 2010, with warmer seawater holding less oxygen due to enhanced greenhouse effects and heat absorption by oceans.

Key research gaps requiring investigation include understanding the relative importance of biological versus physical processes (mixing, currents) in controlling near-bed oxygen dynamics. The impacts of climate change on physical processes, oxygen deficiency and consumption involve complex interactions between physical and biological systems. Recent studies have focused on distinguishing between nutrient enrichment effects and seawater temperature changes from climate change, but this understanding remains incomplete.

OSPAR recommends improved data collection using automated sampling devices supported by modeling to capture high spatial and temporal variability in oxygen measurements. Better spatial coverage is needed since many available data points are in nearshore waters, limiting confidence in marine area assessments. Development of assessment methods including models examining days below threshold values is recommended.

Validated biogeochemical models should assess impacts of targeted reduction scenarios on oxygen concentrations, noting spatial disconnects between nutrient sources and impacted areas. Models can identify hotspots where oxygen deficiency is localized and short-lived, direct future sampling programs, and potentially serve as evidence in poorly sampled regions.

Further research is needed on climate change impacts on hydrodynamic processes and oxygen deficiency. Investigations should determine appropriate seabed depth levels for monitoring minimum dissolved oxygen concentrations, as very low levels may not be detected by current methods. Methodology requires development addressing feasibility of near-bed monitoring and assessment practicalities.",5,"Based on the provided context, there is extremely limited discussion of ocean acidification specifically. The report mentions ocean acidification only briefly as one of the challenges that the North-East Atlantic Ocean should be ""resilient to,"" alongside climate change.

The context primarily focuses on dissolved oxygen depletion and eutrophication rather than ocean acidification. However, some climate-related ocean chemistry changes are documented. Between 1960 and 2010, the amount of dissolved gas in the oceans declined by 2%, with strong regional variations and multiple contributing factors. As more carbon dioxide is released enhancing the greenhouse effect, much of the heat is absorbed by the oceans, resulting in warmer water that can hold less oxygen.

The report notes that increased levels of CO₂ can promote phytoplankton growth above or on the thermocline, which when it decays and is consumed beneath the thermocline can decrease oxygen concentrations. During future climate change, simultaneous shifts in temperature, CO₂, and hypoxia levels will enhance sensitivity to environmental extremes relative to changes in just one variable.

The relationship between climate change impacts and ocean chemistry is acknowledged as complex, with multiple interactions between physical and biological processes. Recent studies have focused on distinguishing between the effects of nutrient enrichment and changes in seawater temperature as a result of climate change.

The context lacks specific data, measurements, trends, or detailed analysis regarding ocean acidification processes, pH changes, carbonate chemistry, or acidification impacts on marine ecosystems in the OSPAR Maritime Area.",2,"The provided context does not contain information about ocean acidification impacts on species, habitats and ecosystems. The context exclusively focuses on dissolved oxygen depletion and its effects on marine life, not ocean acidification.

The context documents the impacts of low dissolved oxygen levels, which create fundamentally different ecological problems than ocean acidification. Hypoxia (dissolved oxygen below 2mg/l) and less severe oxygen depletion cause lethal and sub-lethal effects to benthic organisms and fish, potentially causing biodiversity loss in impacted ecosystems. When oxygen levels decline to hypoxic levels, fish and other marine animals suffocate. In the North Sea, hypoxic conditions in the 1980s caused death of benthic and demersal species. Baltic Sea observations show that when bottom water oxygen content is very low, only bacteria living on and in the seafloor can thrive.

Oxygen depletion results in behavioral changes or death of fish and bottom fauna and flora. Negative effects on bottom fauna reduce food availability for fish, decreasing fish population productivity. These impacts reverberate through marine systems. Oxygen concentrations above 6mg/l support marine life with minimal problems, while concentrations below 2mg/l cause severe problems.

The context shows that dissolved oxygen in oceans declined by 2% between 1960-2010, with eutrophication-induced hypoxia creating dead zones affecting over 245,000km² of marine ecosystems worldwide. Climate change impacts dissolved oxygen through reduced solubility in warmer water, increased stratification inhibiting oxygenated water supply, and enhanced bacterial consumption. However, these findings relate to oxygen depletion rather than ocean acidification impacts.",1,10,1,28
