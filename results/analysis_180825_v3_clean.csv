Thematic assessment,Benthic habitats,OK,p00957_benthic_habitats_thematic_assessment,"Climate change represents a critical threat to benthic habitats in the North-East Atlantic, with impacts manifesting across multiple environmental parameters and habitat types. Temperature increases are driving significant changes, with middle emission scenarios predicting 3°C rises in sea surface temperature and near-bottom temperature by 2081-2100, while high emission scenarios predict 4°C increases. Deep-sea habitats will experience 1°C rises. Marine heatwaves are becoming increasingly frequent global concerns.

Ocean acidification poses severe threats, particularly to calcifying species like corals and mussels that construct carbonate shells and skeletons. Deep-sea corals with aragonite skeletons are especially vulnerable, with habitat suitability modeling predicting approximately 80% decreases in suitable habitat for Lophelia pertusa by 2081-2100. Waters surrounding Hatton and Porcupine Banks will approach aragonite undersaturation by 2100 under moderate scenarios.

Sea-level rise affects intertidal mudflats and coastal habitats through altered sedimentation patterns, increased storm frequency, and coastal squeeze. The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation is slowing, potentially increasing acidification in deep Atlantic waters and causing broad-scale impacts across the North Atlantic within three decades.

Arctic regions face particular challenges through ""Atlantification"" - increased influence by Atlantic water masses pushing Arctic communities northward. Barents Sea megabenthos biomass fluctuations correlate positively with increasing sea temperatures.

Current benthic indicators inadequately measure climate-driven changes, requiring new assessment tools. Climate change interacts with existing anthropogenic pressures, potentially facilitating non-indigenous species establishment. Despite extensive evidence of impacts across regions, systematic monitoring remains insufficient, with significant data gaps limiting comprehensive assessment capabilities.",,"Climate change poses significant and widespread threats to benthic habitats across the OSPAR Maritime Area through multiple interconnected pressure pathways. Direct and indirect pressures from climatic change and ocean acidification significantly alter environmental conditions essential for benthic ecosystem processes, including increased sea surface temperatures and decreased pH levels, affecting habitat suitability for sensitive species and altering community structures and diversity patterns.

Ocean acidification particularly threatens calcifying species, with deep-sea corals especially vulnerable - those with aragonite rather than calcite skeletons face predicted impacts by century's end. Even short-term pH decreases can impact cold-water corals, with pressures likely increasing over the next 6-12 years. Temperature increases force species to adapt by changing depth and latitude distributions, with algae communities restricted to specific depth ranges being particularly sensitive.

Sea-level rise increases coastal water depth and alters wave and tidal energy patterns, leading to coastal squeeze effects and increased needs for flood defenses. Marine heatwaves are increasing in frequency with predicted intensification. The slowing Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation will influence regional circulation patterns, affecting population connectivity and potentially having broad-scale North Atlantic impacts within three decades.

Climate change compounds existing threats, particularly for habitats already exposed to multiple anthropogenic pressures. For Zostera beds, water turbidity and sediment resuspension worsen under climate pressures. Arctic Waters show climatic factors as the most significant variables driving benthic habitat trends. Climate change also facilitates establishment of non-indigenous species that benefit from its negative impacts on native communities.

Physical disturbance and climate change rank as the highest importance pressures, though impacts from climate change and ocean acidification lack comprehensive indicator-based evaluation despite extensive evidence of habitat sensitivity to these drivers.",,"Climate change impacts species, habitats, and ecosystems through multiple interconnected mechanisms that alter fundamental environmental conditions and ecological processes. Increased sea surface temperatures and decreased pH levels significantly affect habitat suitability for sensitive benthic species, alter species distributions, and modify community structures and diversity patterns.

Temperature increases force species to adapt by changing their depth and latitude distribution ranges, with species unable to modify these ranges being most vulnerable. Ocean acidification particularly threatens marine species with calcium carbonate shells and skeletons, such as corals and mussels, affecting them across their entire life cycle including early development and larval stages. This reduces both established populations and successful reproduction rates.

Ecosystem-engineer species face drastically reduced suitable habitat under worst-case scenarios, leading to population density declines, biodiversity loss, and reduced biogeographic distribution that compromises large-scale connectivity and long-term survival. Deep-sea sponge aggregations experience changes in distribution, extent, and condition due to altered circulation patterns from Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation slowdown.

Coral gardens suffer from increased temperatures affecting distribution, decreased particulate organic carbon inputs, and broad-scale North Atlantic circulation impacts. Early life stages show particular vulnerability to acidification, with ecosystem-scale habitat loss predicted by century's end.

Climate change compounds existing threats - for Zostera beds, it exacerbates water turbidity and sediment resuspension issues. Intertidal mudflats face sea-level rise and increased storm frequency affecting sedimentation patterns and causing coastal squeeze. Changes in precipitation alter freshwater inputs and nutrient loads, while slowed circulation patterns impact regional connectivity.

These effects cascade through food webs, with changes in benthic invertebrate communities causing knock-on impacts throughout marine ecosystems. Biodiversity declines affect ecosystem services including carbon storage, which becomes increasingly important for climate mitigation.",,"OSPAR reports identify several critical gaps in addressing climate change impacts on marine benthic habitats across the North-East Atlantic. Current monitoring systems are insufficient, with large areas having very limited or no monitoring data, particularly beyond coastal zones. Existing benthic indicators designed to measure human impacts like trawling and eutrophication are not sufficiently sensitive to measure changes driven by climatic factors and ocean acidification.

Impacts from climate change and ocean acidification have not been evaluated with established indicator sets, despite wide evidence of habitat sensitivity to these drivers. New or adapted indicators incorporating additional environmental parameters are needed to fill these assessment gaps. There is insufficient understanding of how climate change affects deep ocean circulation and its impacts on larval dispersal of habitat-forming species.

Knowledge gaps exist regarding carbon supply and demand dynamics in deep-water Arctic basins for evaluating future ecosystem changes. The specific impacts of human activities versus climatic effects on Arctic benthic habitats remain poorly studied and documented. Data paucity prevents systematic measurement of climate change effects across different habitat types.

Spatial coverage gaps in biological information limit assessment confidence. Maps of critical habitats like eelgrass beds are patchy, hampering understanding of climate impacts including coastal water darkening and sediment resuspension. Uncertainty exists in predicting future climate impacts on benthic habitats, particularly along coastlines where sea-level rise and increased storminess create additional pressures.

The reports emphasize urgent need for improved monitoring programs, better spatial data coverage, and development of climate-sensitive assessment tools to address these significant knowledge gaps limiting effective climate adaptation strategies.",,"The OSPAR report outlines comprehensive recommendations for addressing climate change and ocean acidification impacts on marine benthic habitats, identifying extensive research needs and management gaps.

Key recommendations include expanding marine protected area networks to cover at least 30% of the OSPAR Maritime Area and assessing their resilience to climate change every six years. The report emphasizes restoring degraded habitats to increase resilience, with specific objectives to develop nature-based solutions for carbon storage by 2025, particularly protecting and restoring seagrass beds, kelp forests and saltmarshes. Management plans must become ""climate ready,"" considering rising sea levels and coastal squeeze effects.

Critical research priorities include developing new indicators specifically designed to measure climate change impacts on benthic habitats, as current indicators are insufficiently sensitive to climatic factors and ocean acidification. The report identifies an urgent need to improve knowledge of marine heatwave impacts on benthic habitats and better understand how climate change affects deep ocean circulation and larval dispersal patterns of habitat-forming species.

Significant data gaps persist in systematically measuring climate change effects due to limited monitoring programs, though substantial evidence exists across different regions. The assessment reveals that existing management measures lack effectiveness evaluation, particularly for carbonate mound protection against climate threats. Current measures appear inadequate, requiring improved monitoring, better geographic coverage, and enhanced resolution in future assessments.

The report emphasizes applying precautionary principles when addressing climate pressures, developing cumulative impact assessment methods, and ensuring future management considers holistic ecosystem-based approaches. Trends in Arctic waters are primarily climate-driven, highlighting the crucial role of climatic factors in benthic habitat changes.",,"Ocean acidification poses significant and well-documented threats to benthic habitats in the North-East Atlantic, with impacts already being observed and greater changes predicted within decades. CO2 uptake is occurring too rapidly for natural systems to adapt, causing pH reductions that particularly threaten species with calcium carbonate shells and skeletons, including corals and mussels, across their entire life cycles from larval stages through adulthood.

Deep-sea corals face severe vulnerability, especially aragonite-skeleton species compared to calcite types, with impacts predicted by century's end. Waters surrounding Hatton and Porcupine Banks will approach aragonite undersaturation by 2100 under moderate emissions scenarios, while most North Atlantic waters except the Celtic margin and Bay of Biscay will become undersaturated under high emissions scenarios. The aragonite saturation horizon is rapidly shoaling in the subpolar North Atlantic within three decades due to altered meridional overturning circulation.

Specific projected changes include pH decreases of 0.15 units with 35% increased H+ ions under moderate scenarios, and 0.35 pH units with 120% increased H+ ions under high emissions scenarios by 2081-2100. Seasonal aragonite undersaturation will affect 20% of UK coastal and North Sea bottom waters. The aragonite saturation horizon will rise from 800m depth under moderate scenarios to 400m under severe scenarios.

These changes will cause ecosystem-scale habitat loss, reduced biodiversity, compromised reproduction success, and food web disruptions. However, knowledge gaps remain substantial - effects on marine benthic species are poorly understood, current monitoring lacks sensitivity to detect acidification-driven changes, and new indicators incorporating additional environmental parameters are needed for proper assessment.",,"Ocean acidification significantly impacts marine species, habitats, and ecosystems across multiple scales and life stages in the North-East Atlantic. Marine species with calcium carbonate shells and skeletons, such as corals and mussels, are particularly vulnerable to pH decreases caused by excess CO₂ uptake. Deep-sea corals, especially those with aragonite rather than calcite skeletons, face particular risk, with impacts predicted by the end of this century.

Species are exposed to acidification across their entire life cycle, including early development and larval stages, meaning acidification not only impacts established populations but also reduces successful reproduction likelihood. This comprehensive exposure threatens population maintenance and could reduce sensitive habitat availability.

Acidification alters environmental conditions necessary for benthic ecosystem processes and functions, affecting habitat suitability for sensitive species, species distributions, community structures, and diversity patterns. For coral systems, acidification can impact reef integrity and cause ecosystem-scale habitat loss, with rapid shoaling of the aragonite saturation horizon possible within three decades in the subpolar North Atlantic.

Significant changes in ocean pH and carbonate chemistry alongside changes in benthic communities are expected within the next three decades, regardless of emissions scenario. Coastal habitat eelgrass beds face predicted slow but significant reduction in condition and distribution over coming decades due to increasing acidification and temperatures.

Climate change and acidification combined represent highly important pressures for benthic habitats, potentially inducing significant shifts in biological communities through altered hydrodynamic regimes and organic matter availability. However, current understanding remains limited, with effects on marine benthic species and habitats not well understood, and insufficient monitoring programs to systematically measure impacts.",,97,47,167
Thematic assessment,Climate change,OK,p00985_qsr2023_climate_change_ta,"Ocean ecosystem services globally face negative impacts from climate change, with greater losses anticipated at higher warming levels according to IPCC and IPBES reports. Marine heatwaves doubled in frequency between 1982 and 2016, increasing in intensity by 0.04°C per decade and expanding spatially by 19% per decade. Climate projections indicate these events will become more frequent and last significantly longer under most socioeconomic scenarios.

Global sea surface temperatures have increased since the early 20th century, with increasing temperatures showing imprints of anthropogenic climate change alongside natural variability. At least half of Arctic sea ice changes can be attributed directly to human greenhouse gas emissions. Climate change triggers widespread changes in the water cycle, altering atmospheric conditions, stratification, and ocean circulation, while climate extremes like storms and waves become more prevalent.

Seven ecosystem services in the OSPAR Maritime Area are directly impacted by climate change, including coastal protection, wild fish biomass, nursery habitat maintenance, climate regulation, and marine ecosystem regulation. Climate change stress may exacerbate human activity pressures, further weakening ecosystem resilience and affecting physical, chemical, and biological cycles that influence the ocean's climate stabilization ability.

The ocean provides critical climate regulation by absorbing CO2 and heat, serving as one of Earth's biggest natural carbon sinks. However, climate change impacts include warming, decreased oxygen concentrations, marine heatwaves, and sea-level rise. Changes in species composition driven by climate change have been observed across all marine habitats, triggering alterations in trophic interactions throughout food webs.

Addressing climate change requires three-pronged action: preparing for climate-exacerbated hazards, building system resilience by managing pressures, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions while increasing uptake and storage.",,"Climate change represents a mounting pressure across the OSPAR Maritime Area through multiple physical and chemical mechanisms. Sea temperatures are increasing, sea ice is shrinking, freshwater input is rising, salinity is changing, and large-scale ocean circulation patterns are shifting. Ocean acidification is occurring as excess atmospheric CO2 is absorbed by seawater. Marine heatwaves, sea-level rise, decreased oxygen concentrations, and increased storm frequency are becoming more prevalent.

These pressures impact marine biodiversity through four primary pathways: habitat loss, species distribution shifts, changes in species composition and food webs, and alterations to life history events. Sea-level rise increases juvenile mammal mortality and affects coastal habitats. Extreme weather events reduce nest survival in waterbirds and create foraging difficulties. Climate-driven changes in species composition trigger cascading effects through trophic interactions and predator-prey relationships.

Climate stress exacerbates pressures from human activities and weakens ecosystem resilience. Seven ecosystem services face direct climate impacts, including coastal protection, wild fish biomass, nursery habitat maintenance, and climate regulation. Most ecosystem services are expected to decline, though marine recreation and tourism may benefit from higher temperatures. Fisheries face species redistribution challenges, while aquaculture risks infrastructure damage and increased disease prevalence.

The combined effects of climate change with other anthropogenic pressures reduce marine ecosystem resilience. Future impacts will likely become progressively more severe, with inland flood risks increasing pollution downstream and compound flooding events becoming more frequent around coasts.",,"Climate change impacts marine species, habitats, and ecosystems through four primary categories: habitat loss, distribution shifts, species composition changes, and life history alterations.

Climate-driven environmental changes reduce the availability of suitable habitats across marine ecosystems. Ocean warming, acidification, changes in oxygen fluxes, increased water turbidity, and sediment resuspension impact all benthic habitats, affecting habitat suitability for sensitive species and altering community structures and diversity patterns. Sea-level rise and extreme weather events particularly impact mammals and birds, increasing juvenile mortality and affecting breeding, wintering, and migration stopover sites. Acidification can cause ecosystem-scale habitat loss, particularly impacting coral reef integrity.

Geographic shifts toward northern ranges are occurring across marine biodiversity, driven primarily by sea surface temperature changes and associated alterations in primary production as species adapt to changing environmental conditions and prey distribution. This tropicalization process reflects species adjusting to new thermal regimes.

Changes in species composition driven by climate change have been documented for marine organisms in every habitat, triggering cascading effects through trophic interactions. Changing phytoplankton and zooplankton communities at the food web base consequently affect benthic and pelagic organisms dependent on them, ultimately impacting top predators like seabirds and marine mammals. Climate change strongly influences plankton communities through changing light attenuation, increasing temperature and sea surface salinity, and their combined effects on stratification.

Benthic communities experience changing species composition and predator-prey decoupling. In shallow coastal areas, sea-level rise, storminess, and extreme weather events alter community structure, while deep-sea impacts remain unclear due to potential nutrient limitation from increased stratification.",,"Based on the OSPAR reports, several critical gaps in relation to climate change are identified:

**Attribution and Causality Gaps**
Strong causal links and mechanisms for directly attributing changes in marine ecosystem quality status to climate change are currently lacking, though future developments may improve this capability. The difficulty in quantifying climate change impacts and fully integrating them to determine resulting changes in overall quality status remains a significant challenge, primarily stemming from difficulty in distinguishing climate change impacts with confidence.

**Monitoring and Assessment Gaps** 
A regional, coordinated monitoring and assessment programme for climate change and ocean acidification has not been achieved to the same degree as for marine biodiversity and ecosystem function. Progress on climate change and ocean acidification has been limited compared to other areas.

**Knowledge and Understanding Gaps**
A more developed understanding of fundamental links between ecosystem responses, climate and other anthropogenic drivers is required. Knowledge gaps remain particularly around cumulative effects of climate pressures. Essential improvements are needed in knowledge and data on possible impacts of climate change, including identification of vulnerable species and ecosystems and possible future shifts in their geographical and temporal distribution.

**Specific Assessment Gaps**
The impact of climate change on provision of genetic material was identified by experts as a knowledge gap. Processes and attribution for some climate change impacts are only tentatively described, often due to relatively short time series or lack of understanding of complex processes and interactions between cumulative pressures.

**Indicator Development Gaps**
Further exploration is needed of how indicators change in response to changes in climate pressures to progress attribution work and improve assessment capabilities.",,"The OSPAR climate change recommendations focus on three primary areas of action: adapting to climate-exacerbated hazards, building system resilience by managing pressures, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions while increasing their uptake and storage.

Contracting Parties should cooperate in reducing existing pressures, managing sea-based renewable energy and carbon capture and storage developments, and monitoring and assessing ocean acidification and climate change. The recommendations emphasize persistent evaluation of climate-related risks and implementation of proactive policies over time to build ecosystem and societal resilience. Adaptive actions should be risk-based, underpinned by understanding projected climate change, and informed by existing ecosystem vulnerabilities.

Key opportunities for mitigation include offshore renewable energy, carbon capture and storage, and protection and restoration of natural carbon stores. The recommendations specifically call for developing a regional approach to applying nature-based solutions for carbon storage by 2025, including protecting and restoring carbon sequestration habitats such as seagrass beds, kelp forests and saltmarshes. Marine Protected Area networks should promote climate resilience by maintaining these ""blue carbon"" habitats.

Critical research needs include developing a more comprehensive understanding of fundamental links between ecosystem responses, climate and other anthropogenic drivers. Strong causal links for directly attributing changes in marine ecosystem quality to climate change are currently lacking. Future investigation should focus on how indicators change in response to climate pressures and explore including physico-chemical pressures within formal assessment frameworks.

The establishment of a permanent working group on climate change is proposed to conduct regular assessments of current and projected impacts and support integration of climate considerations into other policy areas. Strengthened collaboration between ocean acidification and climate change experts is identified as essential for addressing strategic objectives.",,"Ocean acidification in the OSPAR Maritime Area results from the ocean's uptake of approximately one quarter of CO2 released to the atmosphere by human activities, causing a chemical reaction that reduces pH and aragonite saturation state. Open water pH has decreased by -0.001 to -0.002 yr⁻¹, with coastal time series in the English Channel showing higher rates of change. The rate of acidification varies highly between and within regions.

Future climate projections under medium emissions scenarios estimate the average trend of ocean acidification to be -0.0017 yr⁻¹ in Region I, with projections indicating that a small part of the shallow shelf will become corrosive for unprotected calcareous organisms. Under high emissions scenarios, these acidification rates will be higher and corrosive waters will expand to cover a large part of the seafloor.

Acidification impacts marine ecosystems by affecting the integrity of coral reefs, causing ecosystem-scale habitat loss, and threatening benthic habitats through reduced habitat suitability for sensitive species and altered community structures. Ocean acidification acts as an added stress factor on plankton communities and may affect aquaculture, particularly shellfish, by threatening larval development, wild seed recruitment, and adult population resilience.

The most effective mitigation approach is reducing CO2 emissions. Sustained time series for monitoring remain limited, and difficulties exist in quantifying acidification impacts and integrating them to determine overall ecosystem changes. Ocean acidification monitoring became a voluntary parameter under the Coordinated Environmental Monitoring Programme, with an intersessional correspondence group established in 2019 to deliver acidification assessments.",,"Ocean acidification impacts marine species, habitats and ecosystems through multiple interconnected mechanisms across the North-East Atlantic. The process occurs through chemical reactions from atmospheric CO2 uptake, reducing pH and aragonite saturation state, with rates varying locally between and within regions. Open water pH has decreased by -0.001 to -0.002 per year.

Acidification directly threatens calcareous organisms, with projections indicating shallow shelf areas will become corrosive for unprotected species under medium emissions scenarios, expanding to larger seafloor areas under high emissions. Coral reefs face ecosystem-scale habitat loss due to structural integrity damage.

Benthic habitats experience comprehensive impacts from acidification combined with ocean warming, altered oxygen fluxes, increased turbidity and sediment resuspension, affecting habitat suitability for sensitive species and altering community structures and diversity patterns. Deep-sea benthic habitat impacts remain unclear.

For plankton communities, acidification acts as an added stress factor alongside temperature and salinity changes. Predator-prey decoupling between primary and secondary production increases phytoplankton sinking to the seafloor. These foundational changes cascade through food webs, affecting benthic and pelagic organisms dependent on plankton, subsequently impacting top predators including seabirds and marine mammals.

Aquaculture faces particular vulnerability, especially shellfish operations, with acidification threatening larval development, wild seed recruitment, contaminant bio-availability and adult population resilience. Cold-water coral reefs predicted to experience greatest impacts under worst-case scenarios face population density declines, biodiversity loss and reduced biogeographic distribution, potentially compromising connectivity and long-term survival. The combination of acidification with other climate pressures compounds ecosystem stress and reduces resilience.",,272,55,468
Thematic assessment,Eutrophication,OK,p00843_qsr2023_eutrophication_ta,"Based on the OSPAR reports, climate change presents multiple interconnected impacts on marine ecosystems, with significant implications for eutrophication and ocean health.

Ocean deoxygenation represents a critical concern, with the open ocean very probably losing 0.5-3.3% of its dissolved oxygen in the upper 1000m between 1970 and 2010, while oxygen minimum zones are expanding. In coastal regions, ocean warming and anthropogenic eutrophication are very likely the main drivers of deoxygenation.

Temperature increases are fundamentally altering marine ecosystems. Rising sea surface temperatures link to upward trends in meroplankton and benthic organism larvae abundance, while causing downward trends in holoplankton populations. These changes impact benthic-pelagic coupling in coastal and shelf areas, with increased water temperatures leading to phenological shifts, biogeographical changes, and altered plankton abundance.

Climate change significantly affects nutrient dynamics and eutrophication patterns. More frequent and intense floods and droughts create stronger variations in nutrient inputs, while changes in circulation patterns and stratification duration could impact nutrient levels and primary production. Higher river discharges are expected, particularly in northern North Sea regions, with lower annual river flow projected for Region IV and higher flows in Regions I, II, and III.

Sea temperature, freshwater inputs, and storminess affect stratification onset and breakdown, changing biogeochemistry directly and indirectly. Direct temperature impacts reduce oxygen concentrations by increasing phytoplankton growth rates and metabolic oxygen demand, while enhanced stratification inhibits oxygen supply.

The interactions between climate change and eutrophication remain complex and uncertain, with ecosystem responses difficult to predict. Managing non-climate pressures through eutrophication reduction measures will create more resilient ecosystems.",,"Climate change presents multiple interconnected threats and pressures to marine ecosystems in the OSPAR area. Rising sea surface temperatures are impacting benthic-pelagic coupling in coastal and shelf areas, causing upward trends in meroplankton and benthic organism larvae abundance while creating downward trends in holoplankton populations. The IPCC concluded that the open ocean very probably lost 0.5-3.3% of its dissolved oxygen in the upper 1000m between 1970 and 2010, with expanding oxygen minimum zones.

Climate change intensifies eutrophication pressures through multiple pathways. More frequent and intense floods and droughts result in stronger variations in nutrient inputs, with climate change expected to produce more hydrological extremes and higher river discharges, particularly in northern North Sea regions. Changes in seasonal rainfall patterns alter both intensity and frequency of nutrient inputs, where sudden large events cause excessive flooding and increased marine inputs. Rising temperatures directly reduce oxygen concentrations by increasing phytoplankton growth and reducing oxygen solubility, while also increasing metabolic rates and oxygen demand.

Climate change affects circulation patterns, stratification duration, and mixing processes, which profoundly alter biogeochemistry and system sensitivity to eutrophication pressures. These changes impact nutrient levels and primary production, though expectations about directional effects remain uncertain. Temperature increases cause phenological shifts, biogeographical changes, and plankton abundance alterations.

Managing non-climate-related pressures through eutrophication reduction programmes will create more resilient ecosystems. However, separating eutrophication responses from climate change impacts in oxygen depletion events requires further investigation. Ocean acidification interactions with eutrophication effects also need consideration as greenhouse gas emission reduction activities may affect eutrophication impact scales.",,"Climate change impacts species, habitats and ecosystems through multiple interconnected pathways, creating complex ecological disruptions. Increased water temperatures lead to phenological shifts, biogeographical changes, and changes in plankton abundance. Rising sea surface temperatures specifically cause upward trends in meroplankton and benthic organism larvae abundance while causing downward trends in holoplankton populations.

Temperature increases reduce dissolved oxygen concentrations by decreasing solubility, increasing metabolic rates and oxygen demand, and enhancing stratification that inhibits oxygen supply. The open ocean lost 0.5-3.3% of dissolved oxygen in the upper 1000m between 1970-2010, with expanding oxygen minimum zones. This creates hypoxic conditions that harm marine organisms through suffocation, mortality, and behavioral changes, particularly damaging sessile benthic fauna.

Climate change alters circulation patterns and stratification duration, impacting nutrient levels and primary production, though the directional effects remain uncertain. More frequent and intense floods and droughts create stronger variations in nutrient inputs, while changes in rainfall patterns affect freshwater input and run-off intensity. These changes modify biogeochemistry and increase eutrophication risks.

The resulting ecosystem changes include species shifts characterized by harmful algal blooms, reduced species diversity, and trophic cascades in food webs. Energy flow shifts from metazoan food webs supporting higher trophic levels toward microbial food webs, reducing biomass available to fisheries through ""trophic amplification"" effects. Habitat conditions change fish community composition, while increased turbidity reduces light penetration, limiting seagrass and seaweed growth areas crucial for nursery populations. These combined effects create substantial ecosystem disruption with reduced biodiversity and altered food web structure.",,"The analysis identifies several critical knowledge and capability gaps related to climate change's interaction with eutrophication in marine systems.

A fundamental analytical challenge exists in separating eutrophication effects from climate change impacts, particularly regarding oxygen depletion events. This separation challenge complicates understanding how each factor contributes to observed changes in marine ecosystems.

Climate change creates more frequent and intense floods and droughts, resulting in stronger variations in nutrient inputs to marine systems. However, understanding the ecological effects of this larger variability remains incomplete. Additionally, methods to adequately monitor and assess these extreme events for future eutrophication assessments require development to enable proper follow-up of implemented measures.

Projections of climate change impacts on eutrophication remain highly uncertain due to complex interactions with land use patterns, crop choices, rainfall patterns, freshwater inputs, run-off, and storminess effects on turbidity. The direction of climate change effects on circulation patterns, stratification duration, nutrient levels, and primary production cannot be predicted with certainty.

A critical knowledge gap exists regarding the interactions between eutrophication and climate change effects on marine ecosystems. Improved understanding of these interactions is essential for implementing effective management measures and understanding ecosystem responses to eutrophication pressures.

Climate change's impact on nutrient enrichment levels themselves requires better understanding, as changes in circulation patterns and stratification could significantly affect nutrient dynamics. The automated monitoring and modeling of oxygen depletion events needs development for future assessments, particularly as climate change may expand regions experiencing oxygen depletion and increase stratification duration.",,"Climate change is producing both positive and negative effects on eutrophication, with several areas requiring urgent investigation. Adaptation to climate change, particularly switching from combustion sources for power generation and transport, is producing significant decreases in NOx emissions to the atmosphere, leading to reduced atmospheric nitrogen deposition on sea surfaces and decreased eutrophication pressures, especially away from coasts.

However, climate change is causing more frequent and intense floods and droughts, resulting in stronger variations in nutrient inputs to marine systems. Changes in seasonal rainfall patterns and sudden large flooding events cause excessive inputs into the marine environment, with expectations that climate change will result in more hydrological extremes and higher river discharges, particularly in northern North Sea regions.

Critical research gaps have been identified. More investigation is needed to understand the ecological effects of greater nutrient input variability and how to adequately monitor and assess such extreme events for future eutrophication assessments. Improved understanding of interactions between eutrophication and climate change is essential to permit follow-up of implemented measures and understand ecosystem responses to eutrophication pressures.

Climate change may impact nutrient enrichment levels through changes in circulation patterns, stratification duration, and occurrence, which could affect nutrient levels and primary production, though projections remain uncertain. There is particular need to consider eutrophication's role in oxygen depletion and separate this response from climate change impacts. Managing non-climate-related pressures through eutrophication reduction programs will result in more resilient ecosystems. Further analyses of cumulative effects require consideration of exposure pathways and ecological impacts to progress assessment capabilities.",,"The provided context from this OSPAR eutrophication assessment contains minimal specific information about ocean acidification. Ocean acidification is mentioned only briefly in three key instances.

The report identifies ocean acidification as having important interactions with eutrophication effects, noting these interactions need consideration when evaluating marine environmental impacts. Additionally, there is recognition that future changes in activities aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions could affect the scale of eutrophication impacts, suggesting a connection between climate change mitigation efforts, ocean acidification, and eutrophication processes.

The document references two other OSPAR assessments - a ""Climate Change thematic assessment and Ocean Acidification Other Assessment"" - indicating that ocean acidification is addressed more comprehensively in separate dedicated reports rather than this eutrophication-focused analysis.

The context provided is primarily a detailed assessment of eutrophication in the OSPAR Maritime Area, covering nutrient inputs, phytoplankton biomass changes, dissolved oxygen concentrations, ecosystem impacts, and management measures. While ocean acidification is acknowledged as an important environmental pressure that interacts with eutrophication, the report does not provide substantive findings, data, or analysis specifically about ocean acidification processes, impacts, trends, or management approaches. 

To obtain comprehensive information about OSPAR's findings on ocean acidification, the dedicated Ocean Acidification assessment referenced in this document would need to be consulted, as this eutrophication report treats ocean acidification as a related but separate issue requiring specialized analysis.",,"Based on the provided context, ocean acidification is only briefly mentioned as an important consideration in relation to eutrophication effects and climate change, but the document does not provide specific information about how ocean acidification impacts species, habitats, and ecosystems.

The context primarily focuses on eutrophication impacts rather than ocean acidification. The only direct mentions of ocean acidification are: its interaction with eutrophication effects should be considered, that changes in greenhouse gas emission reduction activities could affect eutrophication impact scales, and that climate change and ocean acidification are factors marine ecosystems need resilience against.

However, the document extensively details how eutrophication (which can be exacerbated by ocean acidification) affects marine systems. Eutrophication causes species shifts toward less valued species, increases low-oxygen tolerant species while reducing species diversity, and alters grazing capacity and food web structure. Hypoxic conditions from eutrophication cause mass mortality of fish and invertebrates directly or through reduced prey abundance. Phytoplankton biomass changes affect light penetration, causing habitat loss for seaweeds and seagrasses that serve as nursery areas. Sessile benthic fauna suffer particularly from extreme hypoxia and anoxia, disrupting food webs and water quality regulation. Trophic amplification occurs, with biomass declines becoming more pronounced at higher trophic levels, potentially magnifying impacts on fishery yields.

The context acknowledges that understanding interactions between ocean acidification and other stressors like eutrophication is important for future assessments, but does not provide the specific data needed to answer how ocean acidification alone impacts marine species, habitats, and ecosystems.",,41,4,54

Thematic assessment,Food webs,OK,p00959_qsr2023_foodwebs_ta,"Climate change represents one of the main factors currently affecting marine ecosystems in the OSPAR Maritime Area. The current global trajectory falls short of meeting Paris Agreement goals, with the IPCC sixth assessment cycle showing the world is not on track to limit warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels without massively increased action.

Marine food webs face widespread impacts across multiple trophic levels. Phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass and abundance are declining across the Greater North Sea, Celtic Seas, Bay of Biscay and Iberian Coast, with these downward trends directly linked to rising sea surface temperatures. Primary production shows a significant decreasing trend for the North Atlantic, attributed to increasing sea surface temperature, though coastal North Sea production has increased since 2015.

Species distributions are shifting northward and to greater depths at unprecedented rates due to global warming. Climate change threatens cold-water corals and deep-sea fishes, forcing habitat shifts to northern latitudes. In the Barents Sea, climate change currently represents a stronger driver than fishing, with substantially increasing air and water temperatures causing sea ice and habitat loss.

The impacts vary heterogeneously across species due to different environmental preferences, creating complex trophic network changes dependent on species composition and spatiotemporal dynamics. Climate warming disrupts synchronization of key trophic interactions by altering phenology across taxa. Ocean acidification affects shell-forming species, while increased terrestrial dissolved organic carbon loads alter coastal primary productivity.

Long-term projections for the Seine Bay indicate climate change will negatively affect ecosystem functioning by 2100, reducing resistance to external perturbations. These effects combine with other drivers to create unexpected cumulative impacts on ecosystem structure and function.",,"Climate change represents one of the main factors currently affecting marine ecosystems and their feeding interactions throughout the OSPAR Maritime Area. In Arctic Waters specifically, climate change is currently the strongest driver of change in the marine food web.

The warming waters are changing the distribution and range of many species throughout the food web, with species displacement occurring towards northern areas or greater depths. This has already affected primary production rates and species composition of phytoplankton and zooplankton, triggering cascading changes at other trophic levels. Climate change alters species phenology and life-cycle events, leading to desynchronization of biotic interactions, particularly predator-prey relationships. Rising sea surface temperatures have caused decreasing trends in holoplankton, large copepods, and small copepods, with significant upward trends in meroplankton and larval fish abundance.

Temperature increases cause changes in timing and decreased magnitude of phytoplankton blooms, reducing organic matter transport to benthos and inorganic nutrient release from marine sediments. General patterns show decreasing phytoplankton and zooplankton abundance across the Greater North Sea, Celtic Seas, Bay of Biscay and Iberian Coast, with consequences for upper trophic levels.

Global warming enhances marine invasions by species from warmer regions. Climate change impacts ecosystem functioning by reducing resistance to external perturbations, with non-additive cumulative effects when combined with other drivers. Deep-sea ecosystems face habitat reduction for cold-water corals, while Arctic mammals experience territory reduction and increased predation risks. Ocean acidification affects shell-forming species, and increased terrestrial dissolved organic carbon alters coastal primary productivity, fundamentally restructuring marine food webs.",,"Climate change represents one of the main factors currently affecting marine ecosystems and their feeding interactions, with impacts that vary across species, habitats, and ecosystem levels. Ocean warming has triggered multiple cascading effects throughout marine food webs, including increased terrestrial dissolved organic carbon loads into coastal ecosystems that alter primary productivity, and enhanced ocean acidification affecting shell-forming species.

Species impacts manifest through heterogeneous responses due to different environmental preferences, leading to disrupted trophic networks that vary by species composition and spatiotemporal dynamics. Global warming enhances marine invasions by species from warmer regions, with food web models showing these arrivals change organic matter fate within ecosystems, increasing cycling and creating chain-like food webs. Climate change alters species phenology across taxa, disrupting synchronization of key trophic interactions when predators fail to overlap peak resource periods.

At habitat scales, climate change causes spatial distribution shifts of marine species toward northern latitudes or greater depths at unprecedented rates. Arctic warming has resulted in substantial ecosystem changes, with loss of sea ice and ice-associated habitats. Deep-sea habitats face reduced suitable conditions for cold-water corals and fishes, forcing northward migrations.

Ecosystem-level impacts include structural changes in food web organization, with higher temperatures creating less organized systems shifting toward detritus-based webs. Primary production rates and phyto/zooplankton composition changes trigger trophic interaction modifications. The Barents Sea exemplifies where climate change currently represents a stronger driver than fishing. Food webs show decreased phytoplankton and zooplankton abundance across multiple regions, with important implications for upper trophic levels through cascading effects. Long-term projections indicate negative effects on ecosystem functioning by reducing resistance to external perturbations, with climate change creating structuring effects on ecosystem topology and spatial organization.",,"OSPAR identifies several critical gaps in relation to climate change impacts on marine ecosystems and food webs.

Uncertainties persist about the nature of climate change-related primary production trends, affecting both ecosystem models used in climate change studies and satellite data-based models. This represents a fundamental knowledge gap in understanding baseline ecosystem changes.

Essential climate variables including seawater temperature, salinity, current velocity, precipitation, wind changes, and thermocline depth need implementation in ecosystem models to properly assess climate change impacts on trophic levels at population, community and ecosystem scales. Current models lack adequate integration of these critical parameters.

Understanding the management effectiveness of Marine Protected Areas within the OSPAR network remains an important gap, particularly regarding their resilience to climate change and ocean acidification. Geographic coverage gaps exist, especially in the Arctic region, affecting ecological coherence of the protected area network.

Monitoring gaps compromise assessment capabilities. Plankton monitoring datasets show significant spatial and temporal gaps, requiring lower confidence in trend assessments for zooplankton time-series. These data limitations prevent comprehensive understanding of climate-driven changes in marine food webs.

Integration methods and cumulative effects assessments require further development to capture combined impacts of climate change with other human activities on food webs. Current approaches cannot adequately assess unexpected cumulative effects when climate change combines with other ecosystem drivers.

Deep-sea ecosystem understanding presents particular challenges. Knowledge of environmental preferences and habitat use of different deep-sea species and functional groups remains insufficient for developing models suitable for examining ecosystem-wide climate change impacts. This represents a priority for ongoing modeling efforts, particularly regarding climate-driven changes in spatial distribution of deep-sea fauna and associated ecosystem-wide consequences.",,"Based on the OSPAR report analysis, climate change recommendations encompass both immediate actions and extensive research priorities across multiple dimensions of marine ecosystem management.

**Primary Recommendations:**

OSPAR commits to developing regional-scale ecosystem-based management approaches by 2024 through cooperation with fisheries management bodies to strengthen ecosystem resilience to climate change. The MPA network requires assessment every six years starting 2023 to ensure climate change resilience and appropriate spatial design. Ecosystem restoration of degraded benthic habitats is recommended to safeguard ecosystem function and resilience to climate change and ocean acidification.

**Critical Research Priorities:**

Future work must explore food web indicator changes under IPCC climate scenarios within five years. Development of integration methods and cumulative effects assessments is needed to capture climate change impacts on trophic and non-trophic interactions and ecosystem services. Ecosystem modeling approaches require advancement to explore different scenarios addressing fishing and climate change impacts on food webs.

**Deep-Sea and Modeling Research:**

Development of models suitable for examining ecosystem-wide climate change impacts on deep-sea ecosystems is prioritized, particularly in the Azores. Climate variables including seawater temperature, salinity, current velocity, precipitation, wind changes, and thermocline depth must be implemented in models to understand impacts across population, community, and ecosystem levels. Research into life histories, feeding preferences, and habitat use of deep-sea species is essential for operationalizing these models.

**Additional Investigation Areas:**

Primary production sensitivity studies need expansion, particularly regarding phytoplankton-climate relationships and dissolved inorganic carbon dynamics. Communication of complex food web indicators to policymakers and public requires development. Understanding cumulative effects when climate change combines with other ecosystem drivers represents a significant knowledge gap requiring investigation.",,"Ocean acidification emerges as a significant pressure affecting marine food webs across the OSPAR Maritime Area, though key knowledge gaps remain. Pilot assessments revealed significant downward trends in primary production linked to decreasing modelled pH in shelf ecosystems. Plankton community assessments showed holoplankton experienced significant downward trends specifically linked to ocean acidification, while changes in dinoflagellates, large copepods and small copepods were linked to rising sea surface temperatures combined with decreasing modelled pH for holoplankton.

Climate change has increased ocean acidification with documented effects on shell-forming species and impacts on food web interactions, with consumers expected to be affected by changes to the nutritional quality of their prey. In the North Atlantic, projected changes include decreased pH and saturation of carbon cycle minerals like calcite and aragonite. Ocean acidification represents a key stressor that may contribute to ecosystem food web stabilization and alter food web energy flow through synergistic effects with other climate pressures.

Critical uncertainties persist regarding causality. It remains unclear whether detected decreases in primary production result from ocean acidification or whether decreased primary production causes decreasing pH, since pH changes arise from dissolved inorganic carbon concentrations that depend on phytoplankton activity balancing production and respiration. The existing literature has not investigated links between ocean acidification and primary production over long-term timescales. Further investigations are needed to untangle relationships between phytoplankton activity, long-term dissolved inorganic carbon concentrations, and anthropogenic CO2. Ecosystem restoration efforts specifically target safeguarding ecosystem resilience to ocean acidification alongside climate change.",,"Ocean acidification impacts species, habitats and ecosystems primarily through bottom-up effects that cascade through marine food webs. Shell-forming species experience direct effects from ocean acidification, which alters food web interactions as consumers are affected by changes to the nutritional quality of their prey. Holoplankton changes are specifically linked to ocean acidification, while primary production shows significant downward trends connected to decreasing modelled pH in several regions.

Primary productivity declines linked to decreasing pH have been observed in the Celtic Sea and shelf ecosystems, though the causal relationship between ocean acidification and primary production over long-term timescales requires further investigation. Changes in phytoplankton activity affect dissolved inorganic carbon concentrations, creating complex feedback loops with pH levels that remain poorly understood.

Ocean acidification combines with other climate change effects to alter marine ecosystems through synergistic interactions. These stressors contribute to ecosystem food web stabilization changes and alter energy flow patterns. Climate change forces species displacement toward northern areas or greater depths, fundamentally affecting food web interactions and trophic networks.

Deep-sea ecosystems face particular vulnerability, with projections indicating significant changes in deep-water mass properties, including decreased pH and altered saturation of carbon cycle minerals like calcite and aragonite. Cold-water corals may lose suitable habitat, forcing northward shifts that raise questions about ecosystem-wide impacts.

The cascading effects extend throughout trophic levels, with declining phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass and abundance having implications for upper trophic levels. These changes affect ecosystem service provision, with no positive outcomes observed for marine food web services. Ecosystem resilience indicators suggest decreasing resilience, while trophic interactions become increasingly disrupted as species respond heterogeneously to acidification based on their environmental preferences.",,86,12,120
Thematic assessment,Hazardous Substances,OK,p00986_qsr2023_hazardous_substances_ta,"Climate change significantly amplifies hazardous substance contamination in marine environments through multiple pathways. Temperature increases and extreme events enhance the release, transportation, and mobilization of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic pollutants, while increasing pollutant toxicity. The expected 2°C temperature increase will raise chemical reaction rates by approximately 20%, leading to higher biological uptake due to faster growth rates in warmer waters.

Increased temperatures affect volatilization of pesticides and persistent organic pollutants including dioxins, DDT, PCBs, and PAHs, while also accelerating their degradation, thereby increasing global mobility and transportability. Temperature rise produces more precipitation, causing floods and higher run-offs of metals and POPs. This has already been observed with DDT increases in shellfish linked to soil mobilization from increased precipitation.

Climate change contributes to oxygen depletion (hypoxia and anoxia), increasing methylmercury uptake in food webs. For mercury specifically, increasing temperatures with related hypoxia, forest fires, and reduced ocean circulation increase methylmercury production in sediments, leading to higher releases from anoxic sediments. Forest fires release mercury stored in terrestrial soils, while higher atmospheric residence times and winds increase long-range transport.

Increased wind speeds and storms erode coastal landfill sites, resuspend coastal sediments, and cause general coastline erosion, releasing stored hazardous substances into marine environments. Ocean acidification could increase metal release from sediments since most metals become more soluble at lower pH. Climate change effects introduce pest species requiring more pesticides in colder regions, increasing marine run-off. These climate-induced increases in contaminant pressures and concentrations reduce the effectiveness of efforts to decrease inputs, particularly from historic contaminants in sediments.",,"Climate change creates multiple interconnected threats that significantly amplify hazardous substance pressures in marine environments. Temperature increases and extreme weather events enhance the release, transportation, and mobilization of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic pollutants throughout marine systems. Rising temperatures directly increase pollutant toxicity and accelerate chemical reaction rates - an expected 2°C temperature increase would boost reaction rates by approximately 20%, following the rule that 10°C increases roughly double reaction rates.

Climate-driven oxygen depletion creates hypoxic and anoxic conditions that increase methylmercury uptake in food webs and enhance contaminant toxicity in multiple cases. Rising temperatures, combined with increasing hypoxia, forest fires, and reduced ocean circulation, boost methylmercury production in sediments, causing higher releases from anoxic sediments into overlying water columns. Forest fires release mercury stored in terrestrial soils, while higher atmospheric residence times and stronger winds increase long-range transport.

Temperature increases affect volatilization of pesticides and persistent organic pollutants including dioxins, DDT, PCDD/Fs, PCBs and PAHs, while also promoting degradation processes like pesticide hydrolyzation, thereby increasing global mobility and transportability. Increased precipitation leads to flooding and higher runoff of metals and persistent organic pollutants. DDT increases in shellfish have been directly linked to climate-related DDT mobilization from soils due to increased precipitation.

Enhanced wind speeds and storms cause erosion of coastal landfill sites, resuspension of coastal sediments, and general coastline erosion, releasing stored hazardous substances into marine environments. These climate-induced pressure increases pose risks of canceling out efforts to combat hazardous substance spread, particularly affecting historic contaminants stored in sediments.",,"Climate change impacts marine species, habitats and ecosystems through multiple interconnected mechanisms. Temperature increases enhance pollutant toxicity and accelerate chemical reaction rates, with a 2°C rise increasing reaction rates by approximately 20%. Higher temperatures lead to increased biological uptake of contaminants due to faster growth rates in warmer waters and elevated chemical reaction rates.

Climate change contributes to oxygen depletion (hypoxia and anoxia) in marine environments, which increases methylmercury uptake in food webs and enhances contaminant toxicity. Rising temperatures, coupled with increasing hypoxia, forest fires and reduced ocean circulation, increase methylmercury production in sediments, leading to higher releases from anoxic sediments to overlying water columns. Temperature increases also affect metal uptake in fish and shellfish, with upward trends observed in these species potentially linked to higher temperatures.

Extreme weather events mobilize pollutants through enhanced release, transportation and mobilization of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic contaminants. Increased precipitation causes floods and higher run-offs of metals and persistent organic pollutants (POPs). Temperature rise increases volatilization of pesticides and POPs including dioxins, DDT, and PCBs, thereby increasing global mobility and transportability. DDT increases in shellfish have been linked to soil mobilization from increased precipitation.

Ocean acidification poses additional risks, with decreasing seawater pH leading to higher metal release from sediments since most metals are more soluble at lower pH. Increased wind speeds and storms cause erosion of coastal landfill sites and sediments, releasing stored hazardous substances into marine environments.

These climate-induced changes affect key species including corals, biogenic reefs, sand eels, lobster, crab, cod and mackerel, leading to assemblage changes favoring more short-lived species and compromising ecosystem services.",,"The OSPAR report identifies several significant gaps related to climate change effects on hazardous substances in the marine environment. Most fundamentally, the QSR 2010 did not include any climate change issues in relation to hazardous substances, representing a major previous knowledge gap that this assessment begins to address by placing hazardous substances into the broader framework of climate change effects.

Critical data gaps persist for comprehensive analyses. The Barents Sea, Norwegian Sea, Norwegian Trench and Gulf of Cadiz lacked sufficient data for any integrated analysis using the CHASE method. More broadly, comprehensive analysis of hazardous substance inputs remains unavailable for most substances, with only mercury, cadmium and lead having complete input assessments across OSPAR regions.

Knowledge gaps exist regarding specific climate-contaminant interactions. While temperature increases of approximately 2°C are expected to increase chemical reaction rates by about 20%, and climate change enhances release, transportation, and mobilisation of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic pollutants, the full quantitative implications remain unclear. The report notes that ecotoxicological data remains scarce for substances like PBDEs, with this deficiency persisting for years.

Significant gaps remain in understanding cumulative effects. Full quantitative analysis of cumulative effects requires further consideration of exposure pathways and ecological impacts, with additional analyses and evidence needed to progress assessment capabilities. The interaction between climate change and efforts to reduce contamination presents particular uncertainty, as climate change effects risk cancelling out pollution reduction efforts, particularly for historic contaminants stored in sediments.

Assessment methodological gaps include inconsistent normalization practices across OSPAR regions and insufficient comprehensive coverage of emerging contaminants despite new prioritization tools being developed.",,"Based on the OSPAR reports, climate change poses significant risks that may undermine current hazardous substance reduction efforts. Climate change-induced increases in pressures and contaminant concentration levels are reducing the effectiveness of efforts to reduce inputs, particularly from historic contaminants stored in sediments, potentially inhibiting progress toward better marine environmental status.

Temperature increases enhance chemical reaction rates, leading to higher biological uptake due to faster growth rates in warmer waters and increased reaction rates for contaminants. Pollutant toxicity increases with rising temperatures, while climate change contributes to oxygen depletion, increasing methylmercury uptake in food webs and contaminant toxicity. Temperature rise causes more precipitation, leading to floods and higher run-offs of metals and persistent organic pollutants (POPs), while also promoting degradation of compounds like PCBs and PAHs, increasing global mobility. Increased wind speeds and storms erode coastal landfill sites and resuspend contaminated sediments, releasing stored hazardous substances. Decreasing seawater pH could increase metal release from sediments since metals are more soluble at lower pH.

For mercury specifically, increasing temperatures with related hypoxia, forest fires and reduced ocean circulation will increase methylmercury production in sediments, leading to higher releases from anoxic sediments. Continued coal dependence in Russia, China, and India, combined with increasing forest fire risks, implies rising atmospheric mercury deposition despite Minamata Convention efforts.

Several research gaps require investigation: comprehensive hazardous substance input analyses (currently available for only mercury, cadmium and lead), further analyses and evidence of ecological impacts to progress cumulative effects assessment, and ecotoxicological data gaps, particularly for compounds like PBDEs where data scarcity has persisted for years.",,"Based on the OSPAR reports, ocean acidification is addressed primarily in the context of its interactions with hazardous substances rather than as a standalone environmental concern. The reports indicate that decreasing pH in seawater could lead to higher release of metals from sediments, since most metals become more soluble at lower pH, transferring into the water phase and affecting biological communities.

However, the analysis suggests these effects would probably not be severe, given that most seawaters remain above pH 7.5 and are thus not inherently acidic. The pH changes would most likely pose greater problems in freshwater environments, where buffer capacity is low, rather than in marine systems.

The reports note that marine ecosystems help regulate the chemical composition of both atmosphere and ocean, affecting local and global climate through accumulation and retention of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases like methane and nitrous oxide. This regulatory function can be impaired when marine ecosystem components such as reefs and invertebrate organisms like mussels suffer lethal or sub-lethal effects from hazardous substances, compromising their contribution to water filtration and ecosystem services.

Climate change-induced increases in pressures and contaminant concentration levels are reducing the effectiveness of efforts to reduce inputs, particularly from historic contaminants stored in sediments. These factors could contribute to inhibiting progress toward better marine environmental status regarding hazardous substances effects.

The context provided focuses heavily on hazardous substances and their interactions with changing ocean chemistry, rather than providing comprehensive information about ocean acidification trends, rates, or direct biological impacts in the OSPAR Maritime Area.",,"Ocean acidification impacts marine species, habitats, and ecosystems through several documented mechanisms. Decreasing pH in seawater leads to higher release of metals from sediments, since most metals become more soluble at lower pH, transferring these contaminants into the water phase and biological community. However, the effects are considered limited because most seawaters remain above pH 7.5 and are not inherently acidic, with the pH changes representing a greater problem in freshwater environments with low buffer capacity.

The acidification process affects ecosystem functioning through multiple pathways. Marine ecosystems help regulate atmospheric and oceanic chemical composition by accumulating and retaining carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases like methane and nitrous oxide. As acidification progresses, this climate regulation service becomes compromised.

Ocean acidification particularly impacts species that contribute to critical ecosystem services. Corals, biogenic reefs, microphytobenthos, kelp forests, and invertebrate organisms like mussels face death or adverse effects, impairing their ability to provide water quality regulation through filtration and sediment quality regulation. The degradation of coral reefs, kelp forests, and infauna compromises coastal protection services by reducing their contribution to erosion control processes.

Acidification affects nursery population and habitat maintenance by impacting species of biodiversity importance including corals and biogenic reefs, along with commercially important species like lobster, crab, cod, and mackerel. This leads to changes in species assemblages, favoring more short-lived species over long-lived ones, fundamentally altering marine food web structure and ecosystem stability.",,14,1,20
Thematic assessment,Human activities,OK,p00879_qsr2023_human_activities_ta,"The North-East Atlantic has already experienced significant physical, chemical and biological effects from climate change, including changes in sea temperature, sea ice coverage, sea levels and oxygen levels, a decline in primary productivity in the North Sea over the past 25 years, and shifts in fish distribution. Further climate impacts are expected across different areas of the North-East Atlantic, with human activities now being influenced by climate change and continuing to be affected in the next decade and beyond.

Climate change impacts affect multiple marine sectors. Fisheries face changing stock distributions and sizes, with potential increased catch potential in high latitude areas but decreases further south, creating complexity in transboundary management. Aquaculture experiences negative impacts including production losses from extreme weather events, increased diseases and harmful algal blooms, decreased productivity from temperature rise, and ocean acidification effects on shellfish, though some positive impacts like higher growth rates in warm-water species are possible. Tourism faces challenges from changes in rainfall, extreme weather, sea level rise and beach erosion.

Ocean acidification particularly threatens commercial species, with standing stocks expected to be significantly reduced. Atlantic cod populations may struggle to deal with changing water temperatures, while bivalve larvae are especially vulnerable to shell dissolution. Ocean acidification also leads to dissolution of calcareous structures essential for benthic habitats harboring protected species.

Climate change drives demand for coastal reinforcement materials due to sea level rise, affects Arctic shipping seasons, and influences treatment system challenges through extreme weather events causing infrastructure strain and sewage overflows. Actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, notably major offshore renewable energy expansion, will have additional consequences for the marine environment.",,"The North-East Atlantic has already experienced significant physical, chemical and biological effects from climate change, including changes in sea temperature, sea ice coverage, sea and oxygen levels, a decline in primary productivity in the North Sea over the past 25 years, and shifts in fish distribution. Additional stress from climate change pressures compounds impacts from human activities and may further weaken ecosystem resilience.

Climate change creates multiple threats across marine sectors. Aquaculture faces loss of production or infrastructure from increased intensity or frequency of extreme events like storms or heatwaves, increases in diseases, toxic and harmful algal blooms and parasites, decreased productivity from temperature rise, effects on oyster spat or mussel seed production, and ocean acidification impacts on shellfish. However, some warm-water finfish or shellfish aquaculture may experience higher growth rates.

Fisheries must adapt practices to address changes in extreme event frequency and ensure fish stock resilience, with increasing complexity in assessment, allocation, and transboundary management as species distributions shift. Atlantic cod populations may have reduced ability to deal with changing water temperatures, while bivalve larvae are especially vulnerable to shell dissolution from ocean acidification.

Tourism faces impacts from changes in rainfall, extreme weather events, sea level rise, and beach erosion. Treatment systems confront challenges from extreme and frequent weather events that can overload sewer networks. Aggregates extraction demand may increase due to sea-level rise requiring sand for coastal reinforcement.

Ocean acidification represents a major physicochemical perturbation that particularly threatens calcareous structures essential for shaping benthic habitats, with impacts intensified when coinciding with temperature changes. Climate change mitigation efforts, particularly major offshore renewable energy expansion, will have consequences for the marine environment while addressing greenhouse gas emissions.",,"Climate change significantly impacts species, habitats, and ecosystems in the North-East Atlantic through multiple interconnected mechanisms. The region has already experienced changes in sea temperature, sea ice coverage, sea and oxygen levels, resulting in a decline in primary productivity in the North Sea over the past 25 years and shifts in fish distribution patterns.

Fish stocks face substantial disruption as distributions and sizes change. Stock distributions may increase catch potential in high latitude areas while decreasing further south, though impacts on commercially important stocks remain uncertain. Ocean acidification compounds these effects by acting as a multi-stressor that impacts organisms at multiple developmental stages. Standing stocks of commercial species may be significantly reduced, with Atlantic cod populations showing hampered ability to deal with changing water temperatures and bivalve larvae being especially vulnerable to shell dissolution.

Benthic habitats experience severe disruption through dissolution of exposed calcareous structures that are essential for shaping habitats harboring protected species. Cold-water corals and deep-sea sponge aggregations face particular vulnerability. Although protected and endangered species are more vulnerable to environmental change, ocean acidification impacts all organisms including those of commercial interest.

Climate change increases disease spread, toxic and harmful algal blooms, and parasites while decreasing productivity due to temperature rise. Extreme events like storms and heatwaves intensify, causing species mortality and biodiversity impacts. However, some positive effects occur, including potentially higher growth rates in warm-water finfish and shellfish aquaculture. The cumulative effects of climate change compound impacts from other human activities, further weakening ecosystem resilience throughout the North-East Atlantic.",,"Based on the provided OSPAR reports, several significant knowledge gaps are identified in relation to climate change:

**Assessment and Monitoring Gaps**
Future climate change impact assessments of the OSPAR Maritime Area require development to review how climate change affects human activities and their adaptation strategies. These assessments should be conducted every six years starting in 2023, but represent a new requirement indicating current assessment gaps.

**Activity-Specific Knowledge Gaps** 
ICES has highlighted substantial gaps in understanding pressures from open ocean installations and various marine activities that will be affected by climate change impacts. Deep seabed mining represents a particular concern, as understanding of environmental impacts remains uncertain while the activity may grow due to climate change-driven demand for key metals.

**Adaptation and Response Gaps**
Knowledge gaps exist regarding how human activities will adapt to climate change effects. Treatment systems face challenges from more extreme weather events associated with climate change, but understanding of adaptation strategies remains limited. The effectiveness of management measures under changing climate conditions requires further consideration.

**Cumulative Effects Understanding**
Gaps remain in understanding how climate change compounds impacts from other human activities and weakens ecosystem resilience. While the North-East Atlantic has already experienced physical, chemical and biological effects from climate change, knowledge of cumulative interactions with other pressures needs development.

**Emerging Activities**
Guidance gaps exist for new activities whose intensity or distribution may change due to climate change, including geoengineering, coastal defense infrastructure, and offshore renewable energy expansion. OSPAR recognizes potential needs for new guidance where existing frameworks prove insufficient for climate-influenced activities.",,"OSPAR recommends conducting climate change impact assessments of the OSPAR Maritime Area and its uses in 2023 and every six years thereafter, specifically reviewing how climate change affects human activities and their adaptation strategies. The North-East Atlantic has already experienced physical, chemical and biological effects from climate change, including changes in sea temperature, sea ice coverage, sea and oxygen levels, declining primary productivity in the North Sea over the past 25 years, and shifts in fish distribution.

Key areas requiring further investigation include: gaps in understanding ecological impacts from major offshore renewable energy expansion, particularly given evidence uncertainty despite improved knowledge; deep-sea environment sensitivity and resilience research to prevent adverse impacts from potential mineral resource exploitation; cumulative effects analysis from multiple pressures acting collectively on ecosystem state; and effectiveness assessment of management measures in terms of reducing environmental pressures and cost-effectiveness.

OSPAR will commission or engage with evidence programmes addressing knowledge gaps, develop common principles and guidance for sustainable offshore renewable energy development to minimize cumulative environmental impacts, and periodically assess how key human activities and underlying drivers change over time. Treatment systems face challenges from population growth, extreme weather events, and novel pollutants, with heavy rainfall potentially overloading sewer networks.

The expansion requires balancing direct adverse effects from offshore wind farm construction and operation against adverse effects if climate change continues unabated. Since restraining offshore wind development may not be possible given society's energy needs, responses should focus on directing development to environmentally less sensitive areas, developing effective mitigation measures, or applying compensation measures like habitat creation and restoration.",,"Ocean acidification represents a perturbation of the physicochemical environment that changes water acidity (pH) and functions as a multi-stressor affecting organisms in multiple ways across different developmental stages. The phenomenon leads to dissolution of exposed calcareous structures essential for shaping benthic habitats that harbor protected species.

Standing stocks of commercial species are expected to be significantly reduced under ocean acidification's influence. Case studies indicate that acidification may hamper Atlantic cod populations' ability to deal with changing water temperatures from climate change, while bivalve larvae show particular vulnerability to shell dissolution. Protected and endangered species face heightened vulnerability to environmental change, though acidification impacts extend to all organisms including those of commercial interest.

Ocean acidification affects aquaculture through impacts on shellfish production, with effects on oyster spat and mussel seed production identified as specific concerns. The multi-stressor nature means impacts coincide with other environmental changes like temperature alterations, compounding effects on marine organisms.

The North-East Atlantic has already experienced chemical effects linked to climate change, including changes in sea temperature, sea ice coverage, sea and oxygen levels, declining primary productivity in the North Sea over the past 25 years, and shifts in fish distribution. Future climate impacts are expected to vary across different North-East Atlantic areas, with ocean acidification representing one component of broader environmental changes affecting the marine ecosystem. Research gaps remain regarding detailed quantifications of acidification impacts and their interactions with other environmental stressors affecting marine organisms and commercially important species.",,"Ocean acidification is a physicochemical perturbation that changes seawater pH and acts as a multi-stressor affecting organisms in multiple ways throughout their development stages. The impacts are particularly severe for protected and endangered species, though acidification affects all marine organisms including those of commercial importance.

Standing stocks of commercial species are expected to be significantly reduced under ocean acidification influence. Case studies demonstrate that acidification may hamper Atlantic cod populations' ability to adapt to changing water temperatures from climate change. Bivalve larvae show especial vulnerability to shell dissolution due to acidification effects.

The process leads to dissolution of exposed calcareous structures that are essential for shaping benthic habitats harboring protected species. This structural degradation fundamentally alters habitat architecture and ecosystem function. Acidification impacts coincide with other environmental changes, particularly temperature changes, creating compounding stressor effects.

Effects on shellfish production are specifically documented, including impacts on oyster spat and mussel seed production in aquaculture systems. The multi-stressor nature means organisms experience impacts across multiple developmental stages and physiological processes simultaneously.

Ocean acidification represents a broad ecosystem threat affecting biodiversity at the species level through direct physiological impacts, at the habitat level through calcareous structure dissolution, and at the ecosystem level through disruption of foundational habitat-forming organisms. The combination with climate change effects creates additional complexity, as organisms must simultaneously cope with changing temperatures and altered ocean chemistry, potentially overwhelming adaptive capacities across marine food webs and commercial fisheries.",,32,10,54
Thematic assessment,Marine birds,OK,marine-birds-thematic-assessment,"Climate change has been identified as the main cause of continuing declines in marine bird status throughout the North-East Atlantic. Rising sea levels, temperatures, altered rainfall patterns, and reduced sea-ice coverage have resulted in documented changes across marine ecosystems, with climate change ranking among the top three most important global threats to seabirds.

The primary mechanism driving climate impacts operates through food supply disruption. Increasing sea surface temperatures correlate with declining abundances of planktonic lifeforms, particularly small and large copepods across the North-East Atlantic. This cascades through the food web - sandeel recruitment depends on climate-induced changes in plankton abundance, distribution and timing, while northward shifts in sandeel prey distribution have been documented. Black-legged kittiwakes demonstrate reduced over-winter survival following winters with increased sea-surface temperatures, with breeding success declining the following year.

Climate change affects waterbirds across multiple life stages - in Arctic breeding grounds, during migration stopovers, and in wintering areas. Arctic breeding grounds show reduced productivity and increased predation mortality due to food supply impacts. A north-eastward contraction in wintering ranges reflects milder northern winters, with Arctic skua predicted to cease breeding in certain areas by 2050.

Extreme weather events increasingly impact nest survival and adult foraging success during storms, though food supply changes remain the dominant mechanism. Steep abundance declines exceeding 50% are predicted for fulmar, puffin, Arctic tern, little tern, Sandwich tern and storm-petrel by 2050. Marine birds have proven unable to optimally adjust breeding timing to changing climate conditions, creating temporal mismatches between peak energy demands and prey availability.",,"Climate change has been identified as the main cause of continuing declines in marine bird status in the North-East Atlantic and ranks among the top three most important global threats to seabirds. Rising sea levels, increasing temperatures, changing rainfall patterns, and reduced sea-ice coverage are driving documented ecosystem changes throughout the OSPAR Maritime Area.

The primary mechanism of climate impact operates through food supply disruption. Increasing sea surface temperatures correlate with declining abundances of planktonic lifeforms, particularly small and large copepods, across the North-East Atlantic. This has caused northward shifts in sandeel prey distribution and created temporal mismatches between peak energy demands during chick-rearing and prey availability. Black-legged kittiwake studies demonstrate lower over-winter survival following winters with increased sea surface temperatures and reduced breeding success the following year.

Climate change affects marine birds through multiple pathways: direct mortality from storm ""wrecks,"" prey depletion, habitat loss, and physiological stress. Arctic skuas are predicted to cease breeding in certain areas by 2050 due to direct heat intolerance. Steep abundance declines exceeding 50% are projected for fulmar, puffin, Arctic tern, little tern, Sandwich tern, and storm-petrel by 2050.

Regional impacts vary significantly. Arctic-breeding species show north-eastward wintering range contractions, with 40% abundance reductions in the North Sea versus 18% in Celtic Seas. Thick-billed murre populations in Svalbard, East Greenland, and northern Norway are declining due to oceanographic shifts reducing food supplies in wintering grounds.

Extreme weather events increasingly impact nest survival and adult foraging capability, with growing evidence these may become more important as frequency increases under projected climate scenarios.",,"Climate change represents the primary driver of marine bird declines in the North-East Atlantic, causing pervasive impacts on species through multiple pathways. Rising sea temperatures, sea level changes, altered rainfall patterns, and reduced sea-ice coverage create widespread ecosystem pressures.

The primary mechanism involves food supply disruption. Increasing sea surface temperatures have caused northward shifts in the distribution of key prey species like sandeels and their copepod prey. For seabirds, sandeel proportion in diets has declined over three decades linked to temperature changes. Planktonic abundances, particularly small and large copepods, are declining across the North-East Atlantic due to rising temperatures. Climate-mediated water-column stratification and mismatches between prey availability timing and peak energy demand periods further compound food supply issues.

Species experience direct demographic impacts. Black-legged kittiwake over-winter survival decreases following winters with increased sea-surface temperatures, with reduced breeding success the following year. Arctic-breeding species show north-eastward range contractions, with more than half of Celtic Seas populations and 40% of North Sea populations now in poor status due to milder winters further north. Arctic breeding grounds experience reduced productivity and increased predation mortality due to climate impacts on food supply.

Habitat changes affect waterbirds through breeding location suitability alterations and projected sea-level rise impacts on habitat extent and quality. Extreme weather events increasingly affect nest survival and adult foraging success during storms.

Climate pressures are exacerbated by additional human-induced stressors including direct mortality, habitat loss, degradation, and disturbance, creating cumulative effects that compound ecosystem impacts across the marine environment.",,"The OSPAR report identifies several critical gaps in understanding and addressing climate change impacts on marine birds in the North-East Atlantic.

**Knowledge and Attribution Gaps**
The report reveals fundamental uncertainties in attributing observed changes to climate change impacts. Even where changes between assessments might occur, ""the degree to which it might have been attributable to climate change impacts would, of course, not be known."" There are likely biases in the location of evidence for climate-change effects in seabirds, particularly concentrated around studies in the central North Sea rather than across the entire OSPAR Maritime Area.

**Assessment and Monitoring Gaps**
Currently, there is insufficient understanding and evidence to directly track the complex combinations of human pressures on state changes and their subsequent impacts on ecosystem services. This represents a significant gap that ""should be a focus of study to inform future assessments."" The overall confidence in assessing the relative importance of individual pressures is considered low, with various gaps ranging from severe uncertainties regarding pressure categories to incomplete coverage of OSPAR Regions and limited coverage of bird species reported.

**Geographic and Ecological Coverage Gaps**
There are still gaps in geographic coverage, particularly in the Arctic Waters Region, and in ecological coherence of marine protected areas. Additionally, gaps exist in understanding whether management is effective in achieving conservation objectives.

**Implementation and Effectiveness Gaps**
The report identifies gaps in understanding the effectiveness of measures, noting it's not possible to evaluate whether responses have been effective without understanding if they reduce human activity or pressure and result in positive status changes.",,"Climate change has been identified as the main cause of continuing declines in marine bird status in the North-East Atlantic. Climate change mitigation underlies all other responses, and without such action adaptation is likely to be ineffective. Rising sea levels, temperatures, rainfall changes, and reduced sea-ice coverage have resulted in documented marine ecosystem changes, with increasing sea surface temperatures linked to declining abundances of small and large copepods across the North-East Atlantic.

The strongest evidence of long-term climate impacts on seabirds comes from studies where impacts are mediated through prey changes associated with sea surface temperature variations. Climate-mediated prey availability has been more impactful on seabird population size than extreme weather events, though such events may become more important if they increase in frequency as forecasted. Black-legged kittiwake over-winter survival is lower following winters with increased sea-surface temperatures, with reduced breeding success one year later. The proportion of sandeels in seabird diets has declined over three decades, linked to sea surface temperature changes.

OSPAR will develop common principles by 2023 and guidance by 2024 to promote sustainable offshore renewable energy development while minimizing cumulative environmental impacts. By 2025, OSPAR will assess the marine protected area network's resilience to climate change every six years thereafter. Future responses must account for climate change impacts on marine birds, with focus needed on understanding and tracking ecosystem-wide cumulative effects pathways.

Currently, insufficient understanding exists to directly track from human pressures to ecosystem service impacts - this should be a focus of study to inform future assessments.",,"Ocean acidification is identified as a key pressure on marine ecosystems in the OSPAR Maritime Area, alongside climate change. The North-East Atlantic Environment Strategy includes three strategic objectives specifically addressing ocean acidification: raising awareness, facilitating adaptation to impacts, and implementing mitigation measures.

However, regional evidence for trends in ocean acidification intensity was not available in sufficient detail to be utilized in the assessment. This represents a significant data gap in understanding the specific impacts of ocean acidification on marine ecosystems within the OSPAR regions.

Ocean acidification is recognized as having widespread exposure across the North-East Atlantic, similar to climate change pressures. The strategy emphasizes the need for marine ecosystems to be resilient to both climate change and ocean acidification. Ocean acidification is considered alongside climate change as a fundamental pressure requiring coordinated responses across multiple strategic objectives.

The assessment acknowledges that ocean acidification, together with climate change, represents a pervasive challenge for marine biodiversity and ecosystem health. The lack of detailed regional data on ocean acidification trends indicates this remains an area where enhanced monitoring and assessment capabilities are needed to better understand and address its impacts on marine birds and other ecosystem components in the North-East Atlantic.

While ocean acidification is clearly recognized as an important pressure requiring strategic attention, the available evidence shows significant limitations in the current ability to assess its specific regional impacts or trends within the OSPAR Maritime Area.",,"The provided context does not contain information about how ocean acidification specifically impacts species, habitats and ecosystems. While ocean acidification is mentioned as a strategic concern alongside climate change in several passages, no specific impacts, mechanisms, or effects of ocean acidification on marine life are detailed in the text.

The context primarily focuses on climate change impacts rather than ocean acidification. Climate change effects on marine species are extensively documented, showing that increasing sea surface temperatures are linked to declining abundances of planktonic lifeforms, particularly small and large copepods, across the North-East Atlantic. Climate-mediated changes affect marine birds through altered food supply and availability, with the strongest evidence coming from studies where impacts are mediated through changes in prey associated with sea surface temperature changes. Changes in food supply and accessibility impact adult survival and food supply to chicks, while reductions in nest survival directly affect breeding productivity and recruitment into breeding populations.

The context shows that climate change has pervasive implications for marine bird communities, including changes in breeding location suitability, breeding success, and prey availability. Declining marine bird populations adversely affect ecosystem services by leading to food web imbalances, and climate-induced changes in plankton abundance, distribution and timing influence fish recruitment patterns.

However, the specific question about ocean acidification impacts on species, habitats and ecosystems cannot be answered from this context, as it lacks the relevant scientific data and analysis on ocean acidification effects.",,73,5,84
Thematic assessment,Marin litter,OK,p00878_qsr2023_marine_litter_ta,"Climate change significantly interacts with marine litter in multiple ways across the OSPAR Maritime Area. The exact effects remain unstudied and difficult to predict, with potential impacts being hypothetical and highly uncertain, forming only a starting point for further exploration.

Climate change will not directly affect marine litter itself but will influence atmospheric and ocean circulation, affecting litter pathways and retention. Changing weather patterns and currents caused by climate change affect marine litter distribution. Changes in precipitation patterns will probably increase the frequency and severity of peak rainfall events, resulting in increased flooding and discharge of debris and litter, as demonstrated by the 2021 flooding events in North-western Europe.

Rising average temperatures may increase beach tourism and leisure activities in coastal North-East Atlantic areas, potentially leading to more litter from bottles, cans, and food packages. Sea temperature changes will cause gradual marine species migration from south to north, with marine litter posing additional threats to already vulnerable species adapting to new circumstances. Changing water temperatures could impact food availability, making marine litter ingestion more common.

The future of North-East Atlantic fishing activity remains uncertain and largely dependent on climate change factors, potentially altering associated marine litter patterns. Marine litter weakens ecological resilience and adaptive capacity of marine species and ecosystems, reducing their ability to withstand adverse climate change impacts.

Plastic contributes to greenhouse gas emissions throughout its lifecycle, creating bidirectional relationships between climate change and marine plastic pollution. Measures addressing plastic pollution could benefit both problems through integrated approaches including blue economy and circular economy conservation. Current uncertainty about global warming effects on oceans presents the greatest challenge in predicting future plastic aggregation patterns relative to global circulation.",,"Climate change poses multiple interconnected threats and pressures in the OSPAR Maritime Area, both directly and through its relationship with marine litter pollution. Marine litter weakens the ecological resilience and adaptive capacity of marine species and ecosystems, reducing their ability to withstand adverse impacts from climate change.

Changes in precipitation patterns will probably increase the frequency and severity of peak rainfall events, resulting in increased flooding from rivers and rainfall that leads to increased discharge of debris and litter. The 2021 flooding events in North-western Europe demonstrated these impacts. Changing weather patterns and ocean currents caused by climate change affect marine litter distribution, with water currents, weather conditions and wind having significant influence on deposition and retention of litter on beaches and seafloor.

Sea temperature changes will cause gradual migration of marine species from south to north. Marine litter poses extra threats to already vulnerable migrating species forced to adapt to new circumstances, as changing water temperatures impact food availability, potentially making ingestion of marine litter more common. Rising average temperatures may increase beach tourism and leisure activities, particularly in northern Europe, potentially increasing associated litter items.

The future of North-East Atlantic fishing activity remains uncertain, largely dependent on climate change and resulting stock availability, which could alter marine litter items from fishing activities. Plastic contributes to greenhouse gas emissions throughout its lifecycle, creating bidirectional links between climate change and marine plastic pollution. However, the exact effects of climate change on marine litter issues remain unstudied and difficult to predict, with current uncertainty about global warming effects on oceans representing the greatest challenge in predicting future plastic aggregation patterns.",,"Climate change causes gradual migration of marine species from south to north as sea temperatures change. This migration makes species more vulnerable as they are forced to adapt to new circumstances, potentially increasing their susceptibility to additional stressors. Changing water temperatures can impact food availability, potentially making species more likely to ingest marine litter when normal prey is scarce.

Climate change influences atmospheric and ocean circulation, affecting pathways for marine litter distribution and retention. Changing weather patterns and ocean currents caused by climate change affect marine litter distribution across the OSPAR Maritime Area. Changes in precipitation patterns increase the frequency and severity of peak rainfall events, resulting in increased flooding that leads to greater discharge of debris and litter from rivers - demonstrated by the 2021 flooding events in North-western Europe that moved large quantities of debris downstream.

Climate change alters habitat structure by modifying habitat components including corals, biogenic reefs, and microphytobenthos, leading to changes in species assemblages with shifts toward more short-lived species. These changes increase the range of habitats available for colonization, including by invasive species. The generation of artificial hardgrounds degrades pre-existing habitats favorable to native species.

Marine litter weakens the ecological resilience and adaptive capacity of marine species and ecosystems, reducing their ability to withstand adverse climate change impacts. Some marine species and ecosystems are vulnerable to both climate change and plastic pollution. The future of fishing activity in the North-East Atlantic remains uncertain and largely dependent on climate change among other factors, which could alter marine litter patterns associated with fishing activities.",,"The OSPAR report identifies several significant knowledge gaps regarding the relationship between climate change and marine litter. The current uncertainty about global warming effects on oceans represents the greatest challenge in predicting future patterns of plastic aggregation relative to global circulation patterns.

Critical gaps exist in understanding how changing weather patterns and ocean currents will affect marine litter distribution and retention. While the 2017 OSPAR Intermediate Assessment identified beach litter and seafloor litter indicators as potentially affected by climate change, comprehensive analyses of these interactions remain incomplete. Better understanding of changes in weather patterns and currents would enable more targeted approaches to marine litter management, but this knowledge is currently insufficient.

The report notes that more work is needed on risk assessment related to extreme weather events, particularly given that climate change will increase the frequency and severity of peak rainfall events, potentially leading to increased discharge of debris and litter from rivers and flooding. The 2021 flooding events in North-western Europe demonstrated these impacts, causing large quantities of debris to move downstream.

Regional data gaps are particularly pronounced in the Arctic (Region V), where very little data are available and the area is not well covered by OSPAR's monitoring programme. Limited evidence and degree of agreement exist for Regions I and V overall.

Additional gaps include insufficient understanding of how climate-driven species migration patterns will interact with marine litter impacts on already vulnerable species, and inadequate knowledge of how changing temperatures might affect food availability, potentially making marine litter ingestion more common. The potential effects described are characterized as hypothetical and highly uncertain, requiring further exploration.",,"OSPAR recommends integrated approaches to tackle both climate change and marine plastic pollution simultaneously, recognizing that measures beneficial for one problem can address the other. Specifically, reducing plastic over-consumption can decrease greenhouse gas emissions throughout plastic's life cycle, while engagement in solving plastic pollution can increase climate action.

Key areas requiring further investigation include understanding how changing weather patterns and ocean currents caused by climate change affect marine litter distribution. Research is needed on seasonal influences, weather patterns, and current changes and their effects on litter distribution patterns. The exact effects climate change will have on marine litter issues in the North-East Atlantic remain unstudied and difficult to predict, representing hypothetical and highly uncertain scenarios that form starting points for exploration.

OSPAR identifies specific research needs regarding extreme weather events and risk assessment, particularly to protect vulnerable communities from flooding effects that can increase marine litter inputs. Better understanding of changes in weather patterns and currents would enable more targeted approaches to marine litter reduction and removal at specific locations.

The assessment recognizes that climate change affects marine litter through several mechanisms: increased frequency and severity of rainfall events leading to more riverine debris discharge, changing ocean circulation affecting litter pathways and retention, potential increases in beach tourism extending exposure periods, and species migration patterns that may increase vulnerability to litter ingestion when food availability changes.

Climate change compounds marine litter impacts by weakening ecological resilience and adaptive capacity of marine species and ecosystems. Two marine litter indicators - beach litter and seafloor litter - were specifically identified as potentially affected by climate change, with water currents, weather conditions, and wind patterns significantly influencing litter deposition and retention.",,"The provided context does not contain substantive scientific information about ocean acidification.

The context is entirely focused on marine litter impacts rather than ocean acidification effects.

The context extensively documents marine litter impacts, showing that marine litter has become a major stressor of marine wildlife and ecosystems in the OSPAR Maritime Area. Marine litter weakens ecological resilience and adaptive capacity of marine species and ecosystems, reducing their ability to withstand adverse impacts from climate change. A total of 914 marine species were documented to be affected by marine litter through entanglement and/or ingestion as of 2020, with ingestion documented for 701 species and entanglement for 354 species.

The context reveals that marine litter causes ingestion of plastic particles via filter feeding, suspension feeding and direct ingestion mistaken for food, causing digestive tract blockages and damage. Entanglement occurs especially with filamentous items like loops, packaging bands and derelict fishing gear, leading to immobility, injury and death. Marine litter smothers benthic habitats and generates artificial hard substrate, altering benthic community structure and impacting whole populations. Floating litter acts as a vector for transporting biota including microbes that modify species assemblages.

The context shows marine litter degrades habitat components like corals, biogenic reefs and microphytobenthos, leading to changes in species assemblages favoring more short-lived species and increasing colonization opportunities for invasive species. It impairs water quality regulation through death of reefs and invertebrates like mussels that contribute to filtration. Coastal protection is compromised through degradation of coral reefs, kelp forests and infauna that control erosion.

However, none of this addresses the specific question about ocean acidification impacts.",,25,3,32
Thematic assessment,Marine mammals,OK,p00955_qsr2023_marine_mammals_ta,"Climate change exerts significant impacts on marine mammals in the North-East Atlantic through multiple pathways. Climate change directly affects marine mammals by altering habitat suitability and causing distribution shifts, as animals track preferred environmental conditions such as temperature. Additionally, climate change impacts primary productivity and availability of prey both temporally and spatially, forcing marine mammals to track their prey sources.

The impacts are particularly severe for Arctic species. For example, one species faces main threats from direct and indirect climate change effects, being heavily dependent on sea ice areas to find prey and sensitive to increased disturbance from human presence and predation from killer whales, which may increase as sea ice retreats.

Climate change is likely to increase human activity and associated pressures in Arctic Waters. Measures to adapt to and mitigate climate change will result in increasing noise pollution and disturbance, affecting marine mammals across nearly all regions. The expansion of renewable energy technologies generates high disturbance during construction phases.

Marine mammals contribute to climate regulation through carbon sequestration. Large marine mammals like whales accumulate substantial amounts of carbon in their bodies, and after death, their carcasses lock up significant amounts of organic carbon on the sea floor, representing potential sinks for anthropogenic carbon.

Management responses include assessing Marine Protected Area networks every six years for resilience to climate change, revising threatened species lists to account for climate change impacts, and developing approaches that explicitly consider climate change in network management. However, the impacts of climate change on marine mammals remain not fully understood but will be multifarious.",,"Climate change represents one of the largest threats to marine mammals in the OSPAR Maritime Area, creating both direct and indirect pressures that affect these species throughout the North-East Atlantic. The impacts are multifarious but not fully understood.

Direct climate impacts include effects on habitat suitability and distribution shifts, as animals track preferred environmental conditions like temperature. Climate change also impacts primary productivity and prey availability in both time and space, forcing marine mammals to track their prey. These environmental changes driven by climate change are likely exacerbating existing pressures on marine mammals.

Climate change creates secondary pressures through increased human activity, particularly in Arctic waters. Measures to adapt to and mitigate climate change result in increasing noise pollution and disturbance affecting marine mammals in nearly all regions. The expansion of renewable energy technologies causes high disturbance during construction phases.

Specific species face acute climate-related threats. Bowhead whales experience direct and indirect effects from climate change, being heavily dependent on sea ice areas to find prey and sensitive to increased disturbance from human presence and predation from killer whales, which may increase as sea ice retreats.

The oil and gas industry contributes significantly to climate change while simultaneously creating underwater noise and chemical releases. Climate change pressures interact additively, multiplicatively, synergistically or antagonistically with other pressures, creating complex threat patterns.

Marine Protected Area networks require dynamic approaches to maintain effectiveness as climate change alters habitat suitability and prey abundance. Regular assessments of MPA network resilience to climate change are planned every six years to ensure spatial design and management regimes remain relevant under changing conditions.",,"Climate change impacts species, habitats and ecosystems through multiple direct and indirect pathways. Marine mammals face direct impacts through habitat suitability changes and distribution shifts as animals track preferred environmental conditions, particularly temperature preferences. Primary productivity and prey availability are altered both temporally and spatially, forcing marine mammals to track their prey and adapt their foraging behaviors.

Arctic species experience particularly severe impacts, with sea ice-dependent species like narwhals heavily affected by ice retreat, making them more vulnerable to predation from killer whales and human disturbance. Climate change causes habitat loss and deterioration, including loss of haul-out sites for seals and changes in breeding, nursery, and feeding areas.

The impacts cascade through ecosystem services and food webs. Marine mammals play crucial roles in nutrient cycling, carbon storage, and maintaining food web functionality. Large marine mammals contribute to climate regulation by accumulating significant carbon in their bodies. Their decline would adversely affect ecosystem services through reduced nutrient cycling, biodiversity loss, and diminished carbon storage potential.

Climate change alters predator-prey interactions and can create trophic mismatches. Marine mammals' role in maintaining underwater habitats, including kelp beds, means their absence due to declining abundance could fundamentally alter these ecosystems and associated food web dynamics.

The changes in habitat suitability and prey abundance require dynamic management approaches. Multiple human activities compound climate pressures, creating cumulative impacts on marine mammal populations throughout the OSPAR Maritime Area. Climate change also increases human activity in Arctic waters, adding further pressure to already stressed ecosystems through increased disturbance and habitat modification.",,"Based on the OSPAR report, several significant gaps exist in relation to climate change and marine mammals:

**Spatial and Monitoring Data Gaps**: Large gaps exist in spatial data, especially beyond coastal zones, limiting the ability to assess measure effectiveness. Regional evidence for climate change trends lacks sufficient detail for proper assessment utilization. Data deficiencies particularly impact Arctic Waters assessments, preventing comprehensive indicator evaluations.

**Knowledge and Understanding Gaps**: The impacts of climate change on marine mammals are not fully understood despite being multifarious. Large knowledge gaps and data heterogeneity prevented integration of chemical pollution information into overall status assessments, though this hints at climate change's potential influence on chemical bioavailability. Understanding management effectiveness of Marine Protected Areas remains an important gap.

**Assessment and Implementation Gaps**: It remains impossible to determine whether existing measures can reduce pressures that continue undermining marine mammal status. No measures address pressures from shipping, fisheries, or noise. There is insufficient understanding to directly track connections between human activities, pressures, and ecosystem service impacts.

**Network Coverage Gaps**: Gaps persist in geographic coverage of marine mammals within the OSPAR MPA network, along with ecological coherence deficiencies. The network's effectiveness in protecting marine mammals is limited by this lack of eco-coherence.

**Future Assessment Needs**: By 2023 and every six years thereafter, OSPAR must assess MPA network resilience to climate change, ensuring representation of species and habitats while maintaining relevant spatial design and management regimes. However, current data limitations and knowledge gaps significantly constrain these assessment capabilities.",,"OSPAR recommends a dynamic, adaptive approach to climate change that centers on ecosystem-based management and the explicit consideration of climate impacts in marine protection strategies. The organization mandates conducting regional-scale assessments of the Marine Protected Area network every six years starting in 2023 to evaluate resilience of marine biodiversity to climate change, ensuring the network maintains good representation of species and habitats with relevant spatial design and management regimes.

Key recommendations include adapting responses to climate change impacts on habitat suitability and prey abundance for marine mammals, particularly through dynamic MPA network management. OSPAR emphasizes that climate change mitigation measures must not counteract biodiversity protection efforts, recognizing that healthy oceans contribute strongly to climate regulation. The organization identifies strategic objectives to raise awareness, facilitate adaptation, and mitigate climate change and ocean acidification.

Areas requiring further investigation include developing methods to analyze cumulative impacts on marine mammals, with resulting knowledge used to reduce cumulative pressure severity. Spatial data gaps exist, particularly beyond coastal zones, limiting the ability to determine measure effectiveness. The organization acknowledges that climate change impacts on marine mammals are not fully understood but will be multifarious, affecting distribution, abundance, habitat suitability, and prey availability.

OSPAR requires revising the List of Threatened and/or Declining species to incorporate climate change and ocean acidification impacts. Research needs include understanding climate change effects on chemical bioavailability, developing better assessment criteria for pollutant management, and establishing long-term monitoring programs to evaluate management measure effectiveness. The organization emphasizes need for integrated management approaches considering cumulative impacts and ecosystem services.",,"Ocean acidification has been identified as an important pressure affecting marine mammals throughout the North-East Atlantic. Climate change and ocean acidification pressures are specifically recognized as significant factors for marine mammals, with these impacts described in dedicated thematic assessments.

The strategic response framework includes three key objectives: raising awareness of ocean acidification (Strategic Objective 10), facilitating adaptation to its impacts (Strategic Objective 11), and mitigating ocean acidification (Strategic Objective 12). Multiple human activities have been identified as contributing to these pressures across the North-East Atlantic region.

Ocean acidification impacts will be incorporated into species protection measures, with the List of Threatened and/or Declining species being revised to account for both climate change and ocean acidification effects. Marine Protected Area management will be improved to increase resilience to ocean acidification, and the MPA network will undergo regional-scale assessments every six years to evaluate its resilience to climate change and ocean acidification impacts.

The analysis reveals that ocean acidification pressures may interact with other environmental stresses through additive, multiplicative, synergistic or antagonistic mechanisms, complicating management approaches. Ocean acidification is grouped alongside other significant pressures including input of chemical contaminants, marine litter, and habitat loss from human activities.

However, regional evidence for trends in ocean acidification intensity was not available in sufficient detail for comprehensive assessment across OSPAR regions. The assessment acknowledges low confidence in incorporating ocean acidification data, indicating substantial knowledge gaps that limit full understanding of its impacts on marine mammal populations in the North-East Atlantic.",,"The provided context contains very limited specific information about ocean acidification's impacts on species, habitats, and ecosystems. Ocean acidification is mentioned alongside climate change throughout the document, but no distinct impacts are detailed.

The context indicates that climate change and ocean acidification pressures have been identified as important for marine mammals, with both requiring awareness-raising, adaptation facilitation, and mitigation efforts. The threatened and declining species list will be revised to take climate change and ocean acidification impacts into account by 2030. Marine Protected Area management aims to increase resilience to both climate change and ocean acidification.

However, the document provides extensive detail on climate change impacts, which may offer some insight into broader environmental pressures. Climate change directly impacts marine mammals by affecting habitat suitability and causing distribution shifts as animals track preferred environmental conditions. It impacts primary productivity and prey availability in both time and space, forcing marine mammals to track their prey. These changes affect abundance, demography, and distribution of marine mammals.

The context reveals that environmental pressures generally lead to habitat loss, displacement, increased energy expenditure, and reduced energy gains for marine mammals, with negative consequences for survival, reproduction, and fitness. Such impacts can alter predator-prey interactions and lead to trophic mismatches, negatively affecting marine food web balance.

While climate change impacts are well-documented in this context, specific information about ocean acidification's distinct effects on species, habitats, and ecosystems is not provided.

Climate change reduces the resilience of native ecosystems and habitats, potentially increasing the magnitude of impacts from invasive NIS. A general poleward expansion of marine species due to seawater warming is expected, and the disappearance of summer Arctic Sea ice may lead to increased Arctic invasion by non-native species through more extensive human development and global maritime trade increases.

The combined effects of climate change and rapid transport are anticipated to bring worldwide changes to Earth's biota, including large-scale biotic homogenization, which could exceed the impact of either climate change or NIS invasion considered individually. However, despite theoretical expectations of climate-driven poleward expansion, the influence of climate-related warming on NIS introductions is not strongly supported by current data collected for this assessment, with climate-related secondary introductions accounting for only 5% of NIS introductions in OSPAR regions.

More targeted species-specific analysis and climate modeling are required to quantify climate change risks on NIS introduction and spread. There is limited documentation of causal effects between climate change and NIS, and climate change and invasive species are most commonly treated as independent issues despite their interconnected nature.

Climate change increases the magnitude of impacts from invasive NIS by reducing the resilience of native ecosystems and habitats. The disappearance of summer Arctic Sea ice may lead to increased invasion of the Arctic by non-native species through more extensive human development. Combined effects of climate and rapid transport could bring worldwide changes to marine biota, including large-scale biotic homogenization, potentially exceeding impacts from either climate change or NIS invasion individually.

Multiple drivers contribute to climate change pressures, including burning of fossil fuels, agriculture, and deforestation, creating associated pressures on NIS distribution and abundance. Higher activity levels are expected toward 2030 for aquaculture, renewable energy, and tourism, with increasing climate change impacts anticipated.

Despite hypotheses linking climate change to marine ecosystem degradation through invasive NIS, climate change and invasive species are commonly treated as independent issues.

Ocean warming creates more suitable conditions for NIS while reducing the resilience of native ecosystems and habitats, thereby increasing the magnitude of impacts from invasive species. A general poleward expansion of marine species occurs due to seawater warming effects.

NIS cause multiple ecosystem impacts including declines in native species abundance through out-competition and predation, introduction of parasites and pathogens, changes in ecosystem functioning and food web structure, alterations in species assemblages leading to biotic homogenization, and modifications to ecosystem service provision. The highest identified impact is on aquatic biomass provision. Red king crabs exemplify these effects, having impacted benthic communities where several species now occur with reduced average size and lower local abundance.

Climate change operates as the primary stressor through warming, with less emphasis on altered ocean pH, wind speed, precipitation and salinity changes. The disappearance of summer Arctic Sea ice may lead to increased Arctic invasion by non-native species through more extensive human development.

However, more climate modeling is required to quantify these risks, and there is limited documentation of climate change and acidification effects on NIS introductions despite frequent literature discussion.",,"Several key gaps related to climate change and non-indigenous species (NIS) are identified in the OSPAR analysis.

A critical knowledge gap exists regarding responses needed to reduce NIS spread in relation to climate change and human settlements. The disappearance of summer Arctic Sea ice due to climate change may lead to increased Arctic invasion by non-native species through more extensive human development, yet this pathway remains inadequately addressed.

Climate modeling represents a significant analytical gap. While climate change-induced changes in marine environmental conditions are anticipated to affect NIS introduction and spread, more climate modeling is required to quantify this risk. Despite frequent discussion in literature about ocean climate change and acidification effects on NIS introductions and impacts, limited documentation exists of the causal effects.

Data and monitoring gaps compound climate-related uncertainties. Time lags in data reporting, sparse NIS monitoring, and lack of thorough analysis of environmental conditions mean the NIS introduction rate, especially in recent periods, is likely underestimated. Temperature-mediated effects on selected NIS species cannot be ruled out due to these data limitations.

Assessment gaps hinder understanding of climate-NIS interactions. The influence of climate-related warming on NIS introductions is not strongly supported by collected data and requires more targeted species-specific analysis. Natural dispersal due to climate change accounted for only 5% of NIS introductions, but this finding needs further investigation.

Methodological gaps exist in cumulative effects assessment. Full quantitative analysis of cumulative effects between climate change and NIS requires consideration of exposure pathways and ecological impacts. Further analyses and evidence of ecological impacts are needed to progress this assessment, as climate change and invasive species are commonly treated as independent issues despite their potential combined effects.",,"Based on the OSPAR report, several key recommendations emerge regarding climate change and non-indigenous species (NIS), along with critical research gaps requiring investigation.

**Primary Recommendations:**

More climate modeling is required to quantify the risk of climate change-induced changes in marine environmental conditions affecting NIS introduction and spread. Consideration of climate developments must become part of the response development and adaptation process. Proper management of NIS introductions is essential, considering risks associated with continually changing climate conditions.

The disappearance of summer Arctic Sea ice due to climate change may lead to increased Arctic invasion by non-native species through more extensive human development, yet OSPAR does not currently directly address the recreation and tourism sector in its work.

**Key Research Gaps Identified:**

Important knowledge gaps exist concerning climate change and human settlements in relation to NIS spread responses. A more targeted species-specific analysis is required, as climate-related warming's influence on NIS introductions is not strongly supported by current data collected. The primary climate stressor appears to be warming, with less emphasis placed on altered ocean pH, wind speed, precipitation, and climate-related salinity changes.

Temperature-mediated effects on selected NIS species cannot be ruled out due to time lags in data reporting, sparse NIS monitoring, and lack of thorough environmental conditions analysis, likely underestimating NIS introduction rates in recent assessment periods.

**Integration Challenges:**

Despite hypotheses that global climate change can degrade marine ecosystems through invasive NIS, climate change and invasive species are most commonly treated as independent issues rather than integrated management approaches. Climate change may increase invasive NIS impact magnitude by reducing native ecosystem and habitat resilience.",,"The provided context contains extremely limited substantive information about ocean acidification itself. Ocean acidification is mentioned only in the context of strategic objectives and organizational goals, with seas needing to be ""resilient to climate change and ocean acidification.""

The only relevant scientific finding relates to non-indigenous species (NIS) and climate stressors. When discussing climate change effects on NIS, the analysis identifies that ""the primary stressor appears to be warming, whereas less emphasis is placed on altered ocean pH, wind speed and precipitation and climate-related changes in salinity."" This indicates that altered ocean pH (ocean acidification) receives less research attention compared to warming when studying climate impacts on marine species introductions.

Climate change, including ocean temperature increases, facilitates the introduction and establishment of non-indigenous species and may increase the magnitude of their impacts by reducing the resilience of native ecosystems and habitats. However, climate change and invasive species are most commonly treated as independent issues despite hypotheses that global climate change can lead to marine ecosystem degradation through invasive NIS.

The context extensively covers non-indigenous species management, shipping vectors, ballast water conventions, and ecosystem impacts from invasive species, but provides no data, trends, measurements, or specific findings about ocean acidification levels, rates of change, geographic patterns, or ecological impacts in the OSPAR Maritime Area.

The context focuses exclusively on Non-Indigenous Species (NIS) and their ecological effects in the North-East Atlantic marine environment.

The context contains extensive information about how NIS impact marine biodiversity through multiple pathways: outcompeting and preying on native species resulting in abundance declines, introducing parasites and pathogens, altering ecosystem functioning through food-web structure changes, causing species assemblage changes and biotic homogenization, and modifying ecosystem service provision. NIS affect pelagic habitats, benthic habitats, fish, marine birds and marine mammals. The highest impact identified was on aquatic biomass provision, though several ecosystem service impacts remain uncertain.

Ocean acidification appears only in brief references alongside climate change as environmental conditions that marine ecosystems should be resilient to, and in one mention that altered ocean pH receives less research emphasis compared to warming as a climate stressor. However, no specific impacts of ocean acidification on species, habitats or ecosystems are described in the provided context.

Thematic assessment,Offshore industry,OK,p00905_qsr2023_oic_ta,"Climate change is causing significant environmental transformations across the OSPAR Maritime Area. In the North Sea, water temperatures have risen due to climate change and altered ocean circulation patterns, with ocean acidification also being registered. Arctic waters show more dramatic impacts, experiencing long-term trends of rising sea temperatures, shrinking ice coverage, and large-scale ecological changes, particularly in northernmost areas.

Oil and gas extracted from the OSPAR area constitutes a substantial source of greenhouse gases contributing to global warming, climate change, and ocean acidification. Atmospheric emissions from the oil and gas industry negatively impact climate regulation services by adding CO₂ to the atmosphere. However, overall reductions in all reported atmospheric emissions across the OSPAR area occurred over the last decade, with CO₂ emissions decreasing by 7.5% between 2009 and 2019.

Climate change presents evolving hazards to offshore infrastructure through extreme meteorological and oceanographic conditions including extreme wind, waves, current events, and rising sea levels. These create vulnerabilities from extreme storms and high wave events that can destabilize offshore structures. Design codes for offshore infrastructure are evolving to accommodate future climate change effects on environmental loads and structural requirements.

Reduced Arctic ice coverage may increase offshore activity due to enhanced access to Arctic resources as sea ice retreats following global temperature rises. Pressures and impacts related to climate change and ocean acidification are expected to intensify markedly based on current knowledge.

Carbon capture and storage represents a bridging technology to mitigate climate change, driven by society's need to address climate effects. Fossil fuel extraction and consumption are forecast to reduce over time to meet international climate change mitigation commitments, though oil and gas will remain part of the declining energy mix for many countries.",,"Climate change pressures and impacts will intensify markedly according to current knowledge, with specific regional manifestations already documented. In the North Sea, water temperature has risen due to climate change and changes in ocean circulation, while acidification has been registered. Arctic waters show long-term trends of rising sea temperatures, shrinking ice coverage and large-scale ecological changes, particularly in northernmost areas.

Reduced Arctic ice coverage will likely increase offshore activity as sea ice retreat provides greater access to Arctic resources following global temperature rise. Climate change presents changing hazards to offshore infrastructures through extreme meteorological and oceanographic conditions including extreme wind, waves, current events, and rising sea level. These conditions create vulnerabilities including destabilization or degradation of offshore structures, risks to offshore workers, reduced operating periods, pipeline system damage from sediment transport, and prevented access for maintenance and inspection activities, thereby increasing accident likelihood including pollution incidents.

While design codes for offshore infrastructure exist, they must evolve to accommodate future climate change effects on environmental loads selection, air gaps beneath structures, and other infrastructure impacts. Oil and gas extracted from the OSPAR area constitutes a substantial greenhouse gas source contributing to global warming, climate change and ocean acidification, though end-use emissions assessment falls outside OSPAR's remit.

Carbon dioxide storage presents risks of leakage from storage sites, potentially causing negative marine environmental effects and ocean acidification. Atmospheric emissions from the oil and gas industry negatively impact climate regulation services by adding CO2. Despite policy shifts toward low-carbon economies, unabated emissions risks from offshore oil and gas production persist in the climate change context as fossil fuels remain part of declining energy mixes.",,"Climate change produces multiple cascading impacts across marine species, habitats and ecosystems in the OSPAR Maritime Area. Water temperatures have risen in both the North Sea due to climate change and changes in ocean circulation, with ocean acidification also registered. Arctic waters show more dramatic changes, with long-term trends of rising sea temperatures, shrinking ice coverage, and large-scale ecological changes particularly pronounced in northernmost areas.

These physical changes create habitat alterations that affect species distribution and ecosystem structure. Designated protected areas containing habitats such as sandbanks and biogenic reefs demonstrate higher sensitivity to these changes compared to the wider maritime area. Sensitive benthic fauna, including corals and sponges, face particular vulnerability to changing conditions.

Current knowledge indicates that pressures and impacts related to climate change and ocean acidification will intensify markedly in coming years. The combination of temperature increases, acidification, and ice loss creates compound stressors that trigger large-scale ecological changes. Arctic regions experience the most severe transformations, with shrinking ice coverage fundamentally altering habitat availability and ecosystem dynamics.

Climate change also presents escalating hazards through extreme meteorological and oceanographic conditions, including extreme wind, waves, current events, and rising sea level. These physical stressors can destabilize marine ecosystems and affect species survival and distribution patterns.

The context reveals significant knowledge gaps regarding causality between observed changes at organism level and impacts at population or ecosystem level, indicating that further investigations are needed to fully understand the scope and mechanisms of climate change impacts on marine biodiversity.",,"Based on the OSPAR report, several critical gaps are identified in relation to climate change:

**Monitoring and Assessment Gaps:**
Current knowledge indicates that pressures and impacts related to climate change and ocean acidification will intensify markedly, yet monitoring techniques for carbon dioxide storage require review by 2024 to assess their adequacy in demonstrating permanent retention of CO2 streams in storage complexes. Only two full-scale carbon dioxide storage projects operate in the OSPAR area, making evaluation of regulatory effectiveness impossible due to insufficient data.

**Scientific Knowledge Gaps:**
Scientific knowledge of environmental risks from carbon dioxide storage in geological formations remains developing. The need for improving and refining reporting on environmental monitoring of carbon dioxide storage projects has been identified. Additionally, linking estimated risk levels calculated through risk-based approaches to possible impacts in the receiving environment has not yet been addressed.

**Infrastructure Vulnerability Gaps:**
Design codes for offshore infrastructure must evolve to accommodate future climate change effects on environmental loads and structural requirements. Climate change presents changing hazards including extreme wind, waves, current events, and rising sea level, yet infrastructure adaptation remains incomplete.

**Evidence Gaps in Marine Ecosystem Impacts:**
Causality between impacts at organism level and population or ecosystem level remains unproven, indicating lack of evidence requiring further investigations. Other anthropogenic factors are difficult to exclude when assessing climate-related impacts in marine ecosystems.

**Regional Assessment Needs:**
Water temperatures have risen in the North Sea due to climate change and circulation changes, with acidification registered. Arctic waters show rising temperatures, shrinking ice coverage, and large-scale ecological changes, yet comprehensive impact assessments across all OSPAR regions remain incomplete.",,"The OSPAR report recommends several specific actions regarding climate change, primarily centered on carbon capture and storage (CCS) as a key climate mitigation technology. Fossil fuel extraction and consumption are forecast to reduce over time to meet international climate change commitments, with CO2 emissions reduction through carbon capture and storage serving as a bridging technology to mitigate climate change.

OSPAR has established specific timelines for monitoring and evaluation: by 2024, they will review monitoring results for carbon dioxide storage to assess whether techniques adequately demonstrate permanent retention of CO2 streams in storage complexes. By 2026, they will evaluate the effectiveness of OSPAR measures to ensure permanent storage without significant adverse consequences for marine environment, human health, and maritime area uses.

The report identifies several areas requiring further investigation. Scientific knowledge of environmental risks from carbon dioxide storage in geological formations is still developing, necessitating improved and refined reporting on environmental monitoring of CCS projects. A critical research gap exists in linking estimated risk levels from risk-based approaches to actual impacts in receiving environments. Additionally, while causality between biomarkers and toxic effects at organism levels has been established, relationships between organism-level impacts and population or ecosystem-level impacts remain unproven and require further investigation.

Climate change presents increasing risks to offshore infrastructure through extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and changing oceanographic conditions. Design codes for offshore infrastructure must evolve to account for future climate change effects. By 2028, OSPAR will develop methods for analyzing cumulative effects in North-East Atlantic marine ecosystems, incorporating spatial and temporal information on human activities and pressures to inform management measures.",,"Ocean acidification is already occurring in parts of the OSPAR Maritime Area, with acidification registered in the North Sea alongside rising water temperatures due to climate change and altered ocean circulation patterns. Current knowledge indicates that pressures and impacts related to ocean acidification will intensify markedly in the future.

Oil and gas extraction from the OSPAR area represents a substantial source of greenhouse gases that contribute to ocean acidification, though assessment of emissions from end-use of extracted hydrocarbons falls outside OSPAR's remit. Carbon dioxide storage activities present additional acidification risks - carbon dioxide leakage from geological storage sites could cause ocean acidification with negative effects on marine environment receptors.

Only two full-scale carbon dioxide storage projects currently operate in the OSPAR area. Scientific knowledge of environmental risks from geological carbon dioxide storage remains developing, with identified needs for improved monitoring and refined reporting protocols. OSPAR prohibits carbon dioxide storage in the water column or on the seabed due to potential negative effects.

OSPAR has established specific timelines for addressing acidification: by 2024, reviewing monitoring techniques for carbon dioxide storage to ensure permanent retention in storage complexes; by 2026, evaluating effectiveness of measures to prevent storage leakage and adverse marine consequences; and from 2023, assessing current and projected climate change and ocean acidification impacts every six years to inform national and international actions.

Carbon dioxide capture and storage is positioned as a bridging technology for climate change mitigation, expected to contribute to reducing CO2 emissions, though the limited number of existing projects has prevented comprehensive effectiveness evaluation of current regulatory frameworks.",,"Ocean acidification impacts on species, habitats and ecosystems are acknowledged but minimally detailed in this context. The provided text establishes that acidification has been registered in the North Sea alongside rising water temperatures and changes in ocean circulation. Pressures and impacts related to climate change and ocean acidification will intensify markedly in the coming years.

The context identifies carbon dioxide leakage from geological storage sites as a potential cause of ocean acidification, which may have negative effects on marine environmental receptors. Oil and gas extracted from the area represents a substantial source of greenhouse gases contributing to ocean acidification.

However, the specific mechanisms by which ocean acidification impacts species, habitats and ecosystems are not described in the provided context. The text lacks detail on which species are most vulnerable, how different habitats respond to acidification, or what ecosystem-level changes occur as pH levels decrease.

The context does describe various impacts from other pressures on marine life, including effects on demersal fish species like cod and haddock from produced water exposure, impacts on benthic communities from drilling activities, and effects on corals and sponges from physical disturbances. These findings demonstrate the types of ecological impacts that can occur, but they relate to chemical pollution and physical disturbance rather than acidification specifically.

The text indicates that assessments of climate change and ocean acidification impacts will be conducted every six years starting in 2023, suggesting current knowledge gaps. Scientific understanding of environmental risks, including acidification effects, is described as still developing, with needs identified for improving monitoring and reporting systems.",,19,5,68
Thematic assessment,Pelagic habitat,OK,p00958_qsr2023_pelagic_habitats_ta,"Climate change represents the most important pressure currently impacting pelagic systems across all OSPAR regions. All regions are experiencing increasing sea surface temperatures and decreasing pH due to ocean acidification, with the strongest warming occurring over the past two decades.

Human activities have altered atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations through fossil fuel burning, industrialized farming, and deforestation. These changes affect pelagic systems through ocean temperature increases, altered stratification/mixing regimes, potential oxygen depletion, modified upwelling patterns, changed atmospheric and oceanographic circulation, and ocean acidification. Climate change pressures specifically include increased sea temperatures, open ocean stratification, acidification, nutrient changes, and altered upwelling intensity.

Widespread changes in plankton communities have been statistically linked to rising sea surface temperatures from 1960-2019, with the strongest effects in shelf and oceanic habitats. Phytoplankton biomass has declined across pelagic habitats over recent decades, while zooplankton abundance shows net increasing trends. Cold-water species are being replaced by warm-water species as distributions shift northward. Long-term time series data (1958-2017) demonstrate increasing diatom abundance in northern waters and declining abundance in southern waters, linked to climate warming.

Ocean warming is expected to reduce the ocean's capacity as a carbon dioxide sink. Elevated sea surface temperatures have altered seasonal stratification patterns, causing greater nutrient depletion during growing seasons and shifting pelagic food webs toward less desirable states. Climate change affects the predictability of primary production patterns and impacts ecosystem services provided by plankton.

Global climate action needs massive increases to meet Paris Agreement targets. Climate change pressures are expected to intensify and persist long-term, with no positive outcomes observed or expected for pelagic ecosystem services.",,"Human-induced climate change represents the most significant pressure on pelagic systems in the OSPAR Maritime Area, creating impacts through multiple pathways including changes in ocean temperature, stratification/mixing regimes, potential oxygen depletion, upwellings, atmospheric and oceanographic circulation, and pH (ocean acidification). All OSPAR Regions are currently experiencing increases in sea surface temperature and decreases in pH due to these pressures.

Climate change has driven widespread changes in plankton communities over the past 60 years, with rising sea surface temperatures linked to declining phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass and abundance, particularly in shelf and oceanic areas. Temperature increases have also caused increasing trends in meroplankton abundance while decreasing copepod abundance. Elevated sea surface temperatures have altered seasonal stratification patterns, causing greater nutrient depletion during growing seasons and shifting pelagic food webs toward less desirable states.

Ocean acidification, driven by increased atmospheric carbon dioxide, accompanies warming but creates substantial uncertainty regarding effects on plankton communities. Climate change is also altering local conditions including wind speed and precipitation regimes, affecting the predictability of primary production patterns and plankton concentration.

Regional variations include strongest warming in the Bay of Biscay and Iberian Coast over the past two decades, particularly in the Gulf of Cadiz, driving decreasing zooplankton abundance. Long-term studies show climate-linked trends of increasing diatom abundance in northern waters and declining abundance in southern waters.

These changes cascade through marine food webs, affecting predator aggregation sites and highly mobile species distributions. Climate change impacts ecosystem services provided by pelagic habitats, with ocean warming expected to reduce carbon sequestration capacity. No positive outcomes are observed or expected for ecosystem services under current climate pressures, and these pressures are expected to intensify and persist long-term.",,"Climate change emerges as the dominant pressure impacting marine species, habitats and ecosystems in the OSPAR Maritime Area over the past 60 years. Sea surface temperatures have risen significantly from 1960 to 2019, causing widespread declines in phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass and abundance, particularly in shelf and oceanic habitats. These temperature increases have altered seasonal stratification patterns, causing greater nutrient depletion during growing seasons and shifting pelagic food webs toward less desirable states.

Species composition changes are extensive, with cold-water species being replaced by warm-water species as distributions shift northward. The dominant Calanus copepod taxa have changed throughout Celtic Seas, while Calanus finmarchicus has shifted its range further north. Rising temperatures have increased meroplankton abundance in coastal and shelf areas by driving increased reproduction and recruitment of benthic invertebrates, while simultaneously causing holoplankton declines.

Ecosystem-wide impacts include disrupted benthic-pelagic coupling, altered timing and magnitude of phytoplankton blooms, and reduced organic matter transport to benthos. Ocean acidification from increased atmospheric carbon dioxide compounds warming effects, though impacts on plankton communities remain uncertain. Climate change affects phenology through mistiming of seasonal events and alters nutrient cycling and energy transfer between habitats.

Food web disruptions propagate from lower to higher trophic levels, affecting predator aggregation sites and habitat use patterns. The North Atlantic right whale exemplifies how rapidly changing conditions force species to shift feeding habitats. Climate-driven changes reduce ecosystem service provision, including carbon sequestration capacity. Unlike regional pressures such as eutrophication, climate change requires global management for effective mitigation.",,"The OSPAR reports identify several critical gaps in relation to climate change impacts on marine pelagic habitats. Future assessments must consider the links between phytoplankton and zooplankton trends within the climate change context, as climate change influences nutrient availability in stratified waters while phytoplankton declines occur throughout much of the OSPAR Maritime Area.

Regional evidence for trends in human activities intensity and climate change/ocean acidification lacks sufficient detail for comprehensive assessment utilization. Assessment units in OSPAR Region IV may not fully capture the hydrological and ecological conditions, requiring refinement to better fit distinct pelagic habitat features and dynamics.

Knowledge gaps include the need to quantify climate change effects on plankton communities and integrate findings into policy development. The drivers of widespread phytoplankton and zooplankton changes remain uncertain in some cases, though these relate to both direct anthropogenic factors and climate change. No positive outcomes are observed or expected from current trends.

Significant uncertainty exists around ocean acidification effects on plankton communities. Future assessments must focus on untangling primary drivers responsible for net pH decline and determining how their influence varies across OSPAR Regions and pelagic habitat types. Current assessments only consider links to abiotic environmental variables, missing potential biotic interactions.

Climate change affects the predictability of physical processes that produce plankton concentration patterns, with changes occurring across multiple temporal and spatial scales that require incorporation into management approaches. Better understanding is needed of healthy, functioning pelagic systems and improved connections between ecological consequences and physical drivers of plankton production for informed management responses.",,"Regarding climate change recommendations, the report indicates global efforts to slow climate change will probably be the best mechanism to counter widespread changes in plankton communities across offshore pelagic habitats. The primary response identified is the Paris Agreement, which aims to limit global warming to well below 2°C and preferably to 1.5°C compared to pre-industrial levels. However, IPCC sixth assessment cycle outputs show the world is not on track to meet Paris Agreement targets and climate change action needs to be massively increased.

The report recommends responses to achieve climate change goals, reduce nutrient inputs, and increase measures for sustainable fisheries as the most significant actions for ensuring plankton community health. Management of carbon emissions is identified as addressing main pressures and drivers of change. Regionally targeted management measures are likely to generate noticeable impact only in coastal areas and where plankton communities face cumulative impacts from multiple pressures like warming and eutrophication.

Key areas requiring further investigation include: untangling primary drivers responsible for net pH decline and determining how their influence varies across OSPAR regions and pelagic habitat types; considering links between phytoplankton and zooplankton trends in the context of climate change for future assessments; quantifying effects of plankton change on ecosystem services; and investigating how phytoplankton biomass affects zooplankton as bottom-up control. The report emphasizes strengthening cooperation with relevant organizations to enhance ecosystem resilience to climate change, noting that climate change represents the most important pressure on pelagic habitats, creating impacts through ocean temperature changes, stratification patterns, acidification, and altered nutrient availability.",,"All OSPAR Regions are currently experiencing ocean acidification, manifested as a widespread decline in pH across all regions. The Ocean Acidification Other Assessment found open ocean areas experiencing pH decline rates between -0.001 to -0.002 yr⁻¹, with the fastest decline occurring at the surface due primarily to atmospheric carbon dioxide influence. In OSPAR Region III specifically, pH decreased at a rate of -0.0019 yr⁻¹.

Ocean acidification results from increased atmospheric carbon dioxide flux across the ocean surface, with seawater pH controlled by dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentrations. Changes in pH link to both phytoplankton activity, since phytoplankton ingest DIC for growth and reproduction, and to atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations - the main driver of global warming.

Significant ecological impacts are emerging. In the Celtic Seas, declining holoplankton abundance in coastal and shelf areas between 1960-2019 appears linked to decreasing pH effects, while phytoplankton diversity remains unaffected. Reductions in pH can affect copepod reproduction and increase vulnerability to food limitation. For calcareous zooplankton like pelagic gastropods, negative pH changes can inhibit shell formation, though these organisms comprise only small proportions of holoplankton abundance.

The relationship between pH decline and observed phytoplankton biomass decreases shows strong correlation, though causality requires cautious evaluation. Reduced phytoplankton biomass causes decreased DIC uptake from water columns, potentially contributing to observed pH declines. However, substantial uncertainty remains around ocean acidification effects on plankton communities, and localized pH trends show greater variation with some increasing trends persisting. Future assessments must focus on untangling primary drivers responsible for net pH decline and determining how their influence varies across OSPAR regions and pelagic habitat types.",,"Ocean acidification is causing widespread impacts across OSPAR regions through a pattern of declining pH at rates of -0.001 to -0.002 yr⁻¹ in open ocean areas. All OSPAR regions are experiencing decreased pH due to increased atmospheric carbon dioxide flux across the ocean surface.

The impacts on species and communities are manifesting through multiple pathways. In Celtic Seas coastal and shelf areas, declining holoplankton abundance between 1960 and 2019 is linked to decreasing pH effects. pH reductions can affect copepod reproduction and increase their vulnerability to food limitation. Reductions in pH were associated with decreasing trajectories detected for both phytoplankton and zooplankton components, particularly within shelf and oceanic habitats.

Ocean acidification impacts are mechanistically linked to dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) dynamics. Phytoplankton ingest DIC for growth and reproduction, so changes in pH affect primary production processes. When phytoplankton biomass declines, DIC uptake by phytoplankton decreases, potentially driving further pH reductions through combined climatic, chemical, and biotic effects.

Ecosystem-level consequences include widespread changes in plankton communities that can impact entire marine food webs, since pelagic habitats provide most energy sustaining these systems. Climate-driven changes affect prey composition, abundance and distribution, influencing aggregation sites for highly mobile species. The impacts cascade through benthic-pelagic coupling, affecting nutrient cycling and energy transfer between habitats.

However, substantial uncertainty remains around ocean acidification effects on plankton communities. The high complexity of ocean acidification dynamics requires future assessments to untangle primary drivers responsible for pH decline and determine how their influence varies across different OSPAR regions and pelagic habitat types.",,94,25,169
Thematic assessment,Radioactive substances Committee,OK,p00920_qsr2023_rsc_ta,"Currently, little evidence exists that climate change is having any impact on radioactive substances within the OSPAR Maritime Area. The one documented effect is increased levels of naturally occurring radionuclides in the Arctic Ocean, which have been linked to reduced permafrost depth and increased mobility of these radionuclides in soils.

However, predicted climate change effects have significant potential to influence many aspects of radioactive substances in the marine environment and could impact current OSPAR assessments and underlying parameters. Specific predicted impacts include: increasing sea levels and storm surge events may result in increased remobilisation of radionuclides from coastal sediments while threatening the safety of coastal nuclear facilities. Changing precipitation patterns, including more extreme precipitation events resulting in increased run-off, could lead to greater inputs of radioactive substances from the terrestrial environment.

Climate change impacts may alter oceanic transport of discharged radionuclides, affecting the distribution of radioactive substances throughout the OSPAR Maritime Area. Warming seas may affect the uptake of radionuclides by marine biota and food web structures, leading to changes in biological transfer of radionuclides.

Ocean acidification shows little current evidence of impact on radioactive substances but may potentially affect radionuclide mobility in the marine environment and their uptake by marine biota through impacts on availability of other compounds like organic ligands.

These predicted climate change effects could influence many aspects of radioactive substances in the marine environment and impact current assessments as well as underlying parameters. The Arctic Ocean shows increased levels of naturally occurring radionuclides, though specific attribution to climate change is not established. Research into climate change impacts is identified as an ongoing need across all OSPAR regions.",,"Based on the provided context, climate change impacts on species, habitats and ecosystems are addressed only in relation to radioactive substances in the marine environment. The context does not provide comprehensive information about broader climate change impacts on marine biodiversity, ecosystems, or habitats in general.

Regarding radioactive substances specifically, warming seas affect the uptake of radionuclides by marine biota and alter food web structures, leading to changes in the biological transfer of radionuclides. Climate change impacts modify oceanic transport of discharged radionuclides, affecting their distribution throughout the OSPAR Maritime Area.

Ocean acidification may affect the mobility of radionuclides in the marine environment and their uptake by marine biota through impacts on the availability of other compounds such as organic ligands. Ocean acidification may also affect the remobilization of radionuclides from sediments due to changes in solution chemistry, particularly pH levels.

Climate change threatens coastal nuclear facilities and increases remobilization of radionuclides from coastal sediments through predicted rising sea levels and storm surge events. Changing precipitation patterns, including more extreme precipitation events resulting in increased run-off, lead to greater inputs of radioactive substances from the terrestrial environment.

Evidence shows increased levels of naturally occurring radionuclides in the Arctic Ocean have been linked to reduced permafrost depth and increased mobility of these radionuclides in soils. However, there is currently little evidence that climate change or ocean acidification are having significant impacts on radioactive substances within the OSPAR Maritime Area at present, though potential future impacts are recognized.

The context lacks information about climate change impacts on broader marine ecosystems, species distributions, or habitat changes beyond radioactive substance interactions.",,"The context identifies several significant gaps in understanding climate change impacts on radioactive substances in the OSPAR Maritime Area. Currently, there is little evidence that climate change is having any impact on radioactive substances within the area, representing a fundamental knowledge gap. However, predicted climate change effects have potential to influence many aspects of radioactive substances in the marine environment, which could impact current OSPAR assessments and their underlying parameters.

Several specific knowledge gaps emerge regarding climate change mechanisms. Rising sea levels and storm surge events may increase remobilisation of radionuclides from coastal sediments and threaten coastal nuclear facility safety. Changing precipitation patterns, including extreme precipitation events leading to increased run-off, could increase radioactive substance inputs from terrestrial environments. Climate change impacts may alter oceanic transport of discharged radionuclides, affecting their distribution throughout the Maritime Area. Warming seas may modify radionuclide uptake by marine biota and food web structures, changing biological transfer patterns.

Ocean acidification presents another gap area, with little current evidence of impact on radioactive substances. However, acidification may affect radionuclide mobility and marine biota uptake through impacts on organic ligand availability, and may influence radionuclide remobilisation from sediments due to solution chemistry changes including pH alterations.

The Arctic Ocean shows increased naturally occurring radionuclide levels linked to reduced permafrost depth and increased soil mobility, but broader understanding remains limited. OSPAR has established an operational objective to assess current and projected climate change and ocean acidification impacts, indicating recognition of these knowledge gaps requiring research to inform future national and international actions.",,"The OSPAR report recommends continued monitoring and assessment of increasing climate change impacts, along with research into climate change impacts across all maritime regions. A key operational objective (S10.O3) establishes the need to assess current and projected impacts of climate change and ocean acidification on the OSPAR Maritime Area to inform national and international actions.

Climate change effects will significantly influence radioactive substances in the marine environment, impacting ongoing assessments and their underlying parameters. Predicted sea level rise and increased storm surge events may cause greater remobilisation of radionuclides from coastal sediments while threatening coastal nuclear facility safety. Changing precipitation patterns, including extreme events, could increase terrestrial radioactive substance inputs through enhanced run-off.

Climate impacts may alter oceanic transport of discharged radionuclides, affecting their distribution throughout the OSPAR Maritime Area. Warming seas may change radionuclide uptake by marine biota and modify food web structures, leading to altered biological transfer patterns. Increased naturally occurring radionuclides in the Arctic Ocean have already been linked to reduced permafrost depth and increased soil mobility.

Ocean acidification requires further investigation, as little evidence currently exists for impacts on radioactive substances. However, acidification may affect radionuclide mobility and marine biota uptake through impacts on organic ligand availability, and could influence radionuclide remobilisation from sediments due to solution chemistry changes.

The report identifies the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, with some parties considering nuclear technologies as part of decarbonisation strategies. For radioactive substances specifically, this climate work will influence reviews of current assessment methodologies and their underlying data and parameters.",,"Based on the OSPAR report context, ocean acidification currently shows little evidence of impacting radioactive substances within the OSPAR Maritime Area. However, ocean acidification presents potential future risks for radionuclide behavior in marine environments through several mechanisms.

Ocean acidification may affect radionuclide mobility in the marine environment and their uptake by marine biota by impacting the availability of other compounds, particularly organic ligands. These chemical changes could alter how radionuclides bind to and interact with marine organisms and seawater components.

Additionally, ocean acidification may influence the remobilisation of radionuclides from sediments through changes in solution chemistry, specifically pH alterations. This is significant because radionuclides that bind to sediments can be released back into overlying seawater through dynamic processes, and acidification-induced chemical changes could enhance this remobilisation process.

OSPAR has established ocean acidification assessment as an operational objective (S10.O3), committing to assess current and projected impacts of ocean acidification on the OSPAR Maritime Area and its uses to inform national and international actions. This assessment work will influence understanding of how ocean acidification affects the impact of radioactive substance releases, emissions and losses on marine ecosystems.

The report indicates that while present impacts are minimal, the potential for ocean acidification to affect radionuclide distribution, bioavailability, and sediment-water exchange processes represents an emerging concern requiring continued monitoring and assessment as ocean chemistry continues to change.",,"Based on the provided context, the document does not contain comprehensive information about how ocean acidification impacts species, habitats and ecosystems generally.

For radioactive substances specifically, this work will influence the review of currently agreed assessment methodologies and their underlying data and parameters.

The provided context is insufficient to answer the broader question about ocean acidification's impacts on marine species, habitats and ecosystems, as it exclusively addresses radioactive substances and does not contain information about impacts on marine biodiversity, ecosystem functioning, habitat degradation, or species-level effects that would typically be expected in a comprehensive assessment of ocean acidification impacts.",,26,6,34
Thematic assessment,Underwater noise,OK,p00880_qsr2023_noise_ta,"Climate change affects underwater noise levels and marine environments through multiple interconnected pathways. Changes in human activities resulting from climate change or from policies addressing climate change alter the levels and distribution of underwater noise. Society's need to mitigate climate effects drives major expansion in offshore wind energy, leading to increased impulsive noise from construction of wind turbine foundations and operational noise from wind farms and service vessels.

Physical environmental changes from climate change influence natural ambient sound levels and sound transmission. These include changes in ice coverage, temperature changes including stratification, sea-level rise, and altered weather patterns such as increased storminess. Reduction in Arctic ice may lead to increased shipping noise, with the Arctic shipping season potentially tripling in length by mid-century, saving 10-12 days on routes from East Asia to Europe. New Arctic shipping routes from European ports could cross areas currently less affected by shipping noise, such as the central North Sea. Arctic environmental changes may also allow tourism vessels to operate for more months annually.

Climate change causes shifts in spatial distribution of fish stocks and other marine organisms, which changes noise associated with fishing activity and alters the impact of underwater noise on different parts of the marine environment. Ocean acidification, which changes seawater pH, was considered for potential links with underwater noise, but no clear connections were identified.

The seismic survey industry uses technology for characterizing and monitoring geological structures for carbon dioxide storage. Cost-benefit analyses show that optimized ship propellers reduce noise while saving fuel costs and helping achieve carbon dioxide emission reduction commitments.",,"Climate change creates multiple threats and pressures related to underwater noise in marine environments. Arctic ice reduction may triple shipping season length by mid-century, leading to increased noise from shipping activity and allowing tourism vessels to operate for more months annually. This expansion into Arctic waters adds pressure from noise in previously less disturbed areas, including central North Sea regions that shipping routes from European ports to the Arctic must cross.

Climate change drives major offshore wind energy expansion as societies seek low-carbon energy solutions, resulting in increased impulsive noise from construction activities including wind turbine foundation piling and unexploded ordnance removal, plus operational noise from turbines and service vessels. Other offshore energy sources like tidal energy will also generate additional underwater noise, though specific effects remain unknown.

Physical environmental changes directly affect underwater noise transmission and natural sound levels. These include alterations in ice coverage, temperature changes with stratification effects, sea-level rise, and modified weather patterns including increased storminess. Ocean acidification represents another physicochemical perturbation, though clear links between acidification and underwater noise remain undescribed.

Climate change alters spatial distribution of fish stocks and marine organisms, causing changes in fishing-associated noise patterns and broader impacts of underwater noise across different marine environment sections. These distribution shifts affect how noise pressures impact marine ecosystems. Additionally, policies addressing climate change modify human activity levels and underwater noise distribution patterns, creating indirect pressure pathways that compound direct climate-related acoustic changes in marine environments.",,"Climate change impacts marine species, habitats and ecosystems through multiple interconnected pathways. Changes to the spatial distribution of fish stocks and other marine organisms due to climate change alter fishing activity patterns and modify underwater noise impacts across different parts of the marine environment. Physical environmental changes include alterations in ice coverage, temperature changes (including stratification), sea-level rise, and changes in weather patterns such as storminess, all of which influence natural ambient sound levels and sound transmission properties.

These climate-driven changes affect species through displacement and modifications in swimming patterns, which impact fitness, survival and reproductive success. Ocean acidification, which changes seawater pH, represents an additional perturbation of the physicochemical environment, though its relationship with underwater noise impacts remains unclear based on current evidence.

Climate change also indirectly affects marine ecosystems by driving policy responses that alter human activities and associated noise levels. The expansion of offshore wind energy as a climate mitigation strategy generates both impulsive noise during construction and continuous operational noise, though effects of other renewable energy sources remain unknown.

These environmental changes combine with existing pressures to create cumulative effects on marine species and habitats. Food web dynamics are altered through changes in species interactions, potentially affecting population growth rates and ecosystem service provision. However, further analyses and evidence of ecological impacts are required to progress comprehensive assessment of these cumulative effects, as the full quantitative analysis requires consideration of complex exposure pathways and ecological impacts across multiple spatial and temporal scales.",,"Based on the OSPAR report, several significant gaps are identified regarding climate change and underwater noise interactions. The primary knowledge gap concerns the unclear relationship between climate change and underwater noise effects, as ""no clear links were described at this time"" despite consideration during the assessment process.

Substantial analytical gaps exist around cumulative effects assessment. Further analyses and evidence of ecological impacts are required to progress cumulative effects evaluation, particularly given that underwater noise can combine with other pressures to collectively affect marine species and habitats. A full quantitative analysis of cumulative effects requires consideration of exposure pathways and ecological impacts that are currently incomplete.

Knowledge gaps persist regarding emerging noise sources. The noise effects of offshore energy sources such as tidal energy remain unknown, despite all human activities causing additional underwater noise. Changes to spatial distribution of fish stocks and marine organisms due to climate change may alter fishing-associated noise impacts, but these relationships are poorly understood.

Monitoring and data collection gaps are evident. A definitive trend in noise activity cannot be determined due to incomplete datasets, and more consistent reporting is needed to improve assessment confidence. Planned coordinated monitoring programmes for continuous sound are still under development, with some regional programmes like JONAS for the Bay of Biscay and Iberian Coast still in progress.

Physical environmental interaction gaps include uncertain understanding of how climate change effects on ice coverage, temperature changes, stratification, sea-level rise, and weather patterns influence natural sound levels and transmission. While potential Arctic shipping increases due to ice reduction are noted, the scale and implications remain uncertain with complex trade-offs between route benefits and Arctic shipping costs.",,"OSPAR recognizes that climate change affects underwater noise levels and marine environmental impacts through multiple interconnected pathways. Climate change policies promoting low-carbon energy are driving major offshore wind expansion, with the European Commission planning expansion from 12 GW to 60 GW by 2030 and 300 GW by 2050, while the UK targets 40 GW by 2030. This growth significantly increases cumulative underwater noise contributions requiring assessment.

Arctic ice reduction may triple shipping season length by mid-century, potentially increasing underwater noise from expanded shipping activity. Climate-driven changes to fish stock spatial distribution may alter noise patterns from fishing activities and modify underwater noise impacts across different marine areas. Physical environmental changes including ice coverage shifts, temperature changes with stratification effects, sea-level rise, and altered weather patterns like storminess will influence natural ambient sound levels and sound transmission properties.

Ocean acidification represents a perturbation of ocean physicochemical environments affecting water pH, though clear links between acidification and underwater noise remain undefined and require investigation.

The Arctic shipping expansion scale remains uncertain due to trade-offs between shorter distances and higher Arctic shipping costs. Changes in marine organism distributions due to climate change may alter both noise generation patterns and impact distributions across marine environments.

OSPAR commits to developing coordinated monitoring programmes for continuous sound by 2022 and producing regional action plans by 2025 to reduce noise pollution. Priority measures include enabling recovery of threatened species and habitats while increasing ecosystem resilience.

Ocean acidification appears as part of broader environmental changes that could influence natural sound levels or sound transmission in marine environments. These physical environmental effects include changes in ice coverage, temperature change (including stratification), sea-level rise, and changes in weather patterns such as storminess. However, the assessment does not elaborate on specific mechanisms by which ocean acidification might interact with underwater noise or affect acoustic conditions in the marine environment.

The treatment of ocean acidification in this context is limited to acknowledging it as an environmental factor that was considered during the assessment process but for which clear linkages to underwater noise could not be established. The assessment does not provide data on acidification levels, trends, or specific impacts on marine acoustics or noise-sensitive species. The focus remains primarily on direct underwater noise effects rather than examining how changing ocean chemistry might modify these acoustic impacts or create synergistic effects with noise pollution on marine ecosystems.",,"The provided context contains very limited information specifically about ocean acidification impacts on species, habitats and ecosystems. The context defines ocean acidification as ""a perturbation of the physicochemical environment of the world's oceans that changes the acidity of the water (pH)."" However, the assessment notes that while ocean acidification's relationship with underwater noise was considered, ""no clear links were described at this time.""

The context primarily focuses on underwater noise impacts rather than ocean acidification effects. The extensive documentation shows that underwater noise affects marine life across trophic levels, from zooplankton to megafauna. Significant zooplankton mortality occurs after exposure to seismic airgun surveys, while larger taxa including marine mammals and fish experience mortality, auditory impairment, heightened physiological stress, masking of biologically important sounds, and behavioral responses. Impulsive sound causes temporary displacement of cetaceans, physiological stress in fish, developmental abnormalities in invertebrate larvae, and in severe cases, permanent hearing damage and blast injuries.

For fish, noise impacts include displacement, changes in swimming patterns affecting fitness, survival and reproduction success, temporal or permanent threshold shifts in hearing, and masking that reduces survival by interfering with detection of biologically important sounds. Marine mammals experience behavioral changes in resting, breathing, diving patterns, vocalizations, and avoidance behavior, plus physiological impacts including hearing threshold shifts and potential injury or death.

The context acknowledges that climate change may affect underwater noise levels and impacts, with changes in spatial distribution of marine organisms potentially altering noise exposure patterns. However, specific information about ocean acidification's direct impacts on marine species, habitats and ecosystems is not provided in this material.",,11,3,16

All other assessments,Assessment data on the management of wastes or other matter (dredged material) 2008-2020,OK,p00971_dredged_material_qsr2023,"Based on the provided context, climate change information is limited but presents two specific forecasted impacts on marine dredging operations. Climate experts forecast greater intensity of storm events, which may lead to increased infilling of channels and harbours. This increased storm intensity is expected to contribute to greater sediment accumulation in navigation areas, requiring more frequent maintenance dredging.

Additionally, the need for dredging may increase due to growth in ship sizes requiring deeper and wider navigation channels, though this relates more to maritime industry trends than direct climate impacts.

The context also mentions ocean acidification alongside climate change as environmental challenges requiring resilience in the North-East Atlantic Ocean, but provides no specific data, impacts, or analysis regarding acidification processes or effects.

The report focuses primarily on dredged material management practices, contaminant loads, and operational challenges rather than comprehensive climate change analysis. No temperature data, sea level rise impacts, ecosystem changes, or other typical climate indicators are presented. The climate-related information constitutes a very small portion of what appears to be a technical assessment centered on dredging operations and sediment contamination monitoring between 2008-2020.

The limited climate change discussion suggests this OSPAR report's primary scope lies elsewhere, with climate considerations mentioned only as they directly relate to future dredging requirements and operational planning rather than as a central analytical focus.",,"Climate experts forecast greater intensity of storm events, which will lead to increased infilling of channels and harbours. This increased storm intensity represents a direct climate-related pressure that will exacerbate existing dredging requirements in the OSPAR Maritime Area.

The need for dredging is expected to increase in future due to both climate pressures and non-climate factors. While growth in ship sizes requiring deeper and wider navigation channels contributes to increased dredging demand, the climate-driven intensification of storms will compound this pressure by causing more rapid sediment accumulation in ports and waterways.

Storm-water overflows, identified as one of the anthropogenic sources contributing contaminants to waterways, harbours, ports and seas, may become more problematic under intensified storm conditions. These overflows contribute to the contamination of sediments that must then be managed during dredging operations.

The cumulative impact of climate-related pressures with other human activities presents additional challenges. Impacts from dredging and dumping at sea of port sediment may be exacerbated by the co-occurrence of other human activities, such as aggregate extraction, fishing and infrastructure development. Climate change is likely to intensify these cumulative pressures.

The context indicates that concepts and methods for impact assessment could be further developed to include dredging and dumping as part of overall cumulative impact assessment, which would be particularly relevant given the anticipated climate-driven increases in dredging requirements. However, the report primarily focuses on current dredging management practices and contaminant loads rather than providing detailed analysis of climate change adaptation strategies for dredged material management.",,"The provided context does not contain information about how climate change impacts species, habitats and ecosystems. The context consists entirely of passages from an OSPAR report focused on the assessment and management of dredged material in the North-East Atlantic Ocean.

The only climate-related finding in the context is that climate experts forecast greater intensity of storm events, which may lead to increased infilling of channels and harbours, thereby increasing the need for dredging operations due to growth in ship sizes requiring deeper and wider navigation channels.

The context primarily addresses dredged material contamination, monitoring of contaminants like cadmium, mercury, lead and tributyl tin, microplastics in marine environments, beneficial uses of dredged material for beach nourishment and habitat restoration, and technical challenges in harmonizing assessment methodologies across OSPAR contracting parties. While the context mentions that more information is being generated on impacts of microplastics and marine litter on marine life, it does not provide specific details about these impacts or relate them to climate change effects.

The document does not contain the scientific findings, data, or analysis needed to comprehensively answer the question about climate change impacts on marine species, habitats and ecosystems.",,"The OSPAR report contains limited discussion of gaps specifically related to climate change. The only direct climate change-related gap mentioned is procedural: climate experts forecast greater intensity of storm events which may lead to increased infilling of channels and harbours, but the report indicates this finding links to an external ""Shipping feeder report"" without providing details on what gaps exist in understanding or managing these climate impacts.

The report primarily identifies gaps related to dredged material management rather than climate change specifically. Major gaps include insufficient harmonisation of assessment methodologies between contracting parties, creating data inaccuracies and preventing comparable assessments. Each party applies different interpretations of OSPAR guidelines, particularly for setting and applying action levels for contaminated material. Incomplete reporting by some parties and inconsistent testing frequencies have resulted in inadequate datasets for full assessment.

Technical gaps exist in detecting chemicals of emerging environmental concern and microplastics in dredged material. Current analytical techniques face challenges in detecting and identifying microplastics and marine litter, though techniques need development for regular assessment of their contributions to adverse impacts. The report notes OSPAR collects data for dredged material management rather than long-term environmental monitoring, limiting trend detection capabilities.

Data collection methods require improvement, such as collecting measured concentration values instead of loads, and increased harmonisation of analyses. Insufficient focused data have been collected on beneficial uses of dredged material, preventing trend assessment. The report also identifies a need to develop cumulative impact assessment methods that include dredging alongside other human activities like aggregate extraction and fishing.",,"The provided context focuses primarily on dredged material management rather than comprehensive climate change recommendations. However, several climate-related findings and research needs emerge from this assessment.

Climate experts forecast greater intensity of storm events, which will lead to increased infilling of channels and harbours. This increased storm intensity, combined with growth in ship sizes requiring deeper and wider navigation channels, indicates that dredging needs may increase in the future.

The report identifies significant research gaps requiring investigation. Technical challenges exist around analytical techniques for detecting and identifying microplastics and marine litter in dredged material. Development and rollout of techniques for regular assessment of litter/debris and microplastic contributions to adverse impacts of dredged material are crucial, with potential inclusion of these substances' management in future OSPAR Guidelines.

Assessment methodologies require further harmonisation to enable detection of chemicals of emerging environmental concern. New chemicals like brominated flame retardants are constantly being developed and may ultimately reach the marine environment. The OSPAR Guidelines for Management of Dredged Material should be regularly amended to include emerging chemicals so baseline conditions can be established and subsequent trends monitored.

Cumulative impact assessment methods need development to include dredging and dumping alongside other human activities such as aggregate extraction, fishing, and infrastructure development, as these co-occurring activities may exacerbate impacts from dredging and dumping at sea.

Data collection improvements are needed, including collecting measured concentration values instead of loads and increased harmonisation of analyses to enable better trend assessment and environmental monitoring capabilities.",,"Based on the provided context, ocean acidification receives extremely limited coverage in this OSPAR report. The document mentions ocean acidification only twice, both times in identical statements referring to the desired resilience of the North-East Atlantic Ocean to ""climate change and ocean acidification.""

The report does not provide any substantive scientific findings, data, measurements, trends, or analysis specifically related to ocean acidification. There are no discussions of pH levels, carbonate chemistry, biological impacts from acidification, monitoring programs for acidification, or management measures addressing this issue.

The context is insufficient to answer questions about ocean acidification comprehensively. This OSPAR report focuses entirely on the management of dredged material, covering topics such as contaminant loads in sediments (particularly cadmium, mercury, lead, and tributyl tin), microplastics in dredged material, beneficial uses of dredged sediment, and regulatory frameworks for waste disposal at sea. The report spans the period 2008-2020 and addresses challenges in harmonizing assessment methodologies across contracting parties, but contains no ocean acidification content beyond the brief aspirational references.

To obtain information about OSPAR's findings on ocean acidification, different sections of the Quality Status Report 2023 or other OSPAR documents focused on ocean chemistry and acidification would need to be consulted.",,"The provided context does not contain information about how ocean acidification impacts species, habitats and ecosystems. This OSPAR report focuses exclusively on the assessment and management of dredged material in the North-East Atlantic from 2008-2020.

The document examines contaminant loads in dredged sediments, including cadmium, mercury, lead, and tributyl tin (TBT). It reports that contaminant loads have decreased and stabilized since the mid-2000s following implementation of OSPAR guidelines in 1998. TBT concentrations have decreased following a complete ban on all ships since 2008. The main environmental concerns identified relate to the release of contaminants from sediment, temporary increases in turbidity, and remobilisation of contaminants to the water column, with potential effects on contaminant availability through the food web.

The report also addresses emerging concerns about microplastics and marine litter impacts on marine life, noting that more information is being generated on these substances' effects. New chemicals like brominated flame retardants are constantly being developed and may end up in the marine environment. The document emphasizes the need for regular assessment techniques to evaluate contributions of litter, debris and microplastics to adverse impacts.

While ocean acidification is mentioned twice in the context of resilience goals, no specific impacts on species, habitats or ecosystems are described. The report's scope is limited to dredged material management rather than ocean acidification assessment.",,1,1,2

All other assessments,Atmospheric deposition of nitrogen to the OSPAR maritime area in the period 1995-2019,OK,p00896_emep_w_qsr2023,"Recent meteorology (2016-2019) has been less favourable for oxidized nitrogen deposition than the meteorology of the 1990s, representing a possible climate change signal that requires further investigation. This meteorological shift has significant implications for atmospheric nitrogen deposition patterns in the OSPAR Maritime Area.

Meteorological conditions exhibit large inter-annual variability that substantially influences atmospheric deposition patterns. The actual (non-normalized) contributions show strong inter-annual variability due to meteorological changes, while normalized contributions better reflect emission changes and policy measure effects over the past 25 years. Due to this meteorological variability, differences between depositions in any single year compared to reference years can change considerably from year to year, necessitating 5-year averages for robust trend assessments.

The EMEP MSC-W model uses meteorological data generated by the ECMWF IFS model, with version cy40r1 covering 1990-2018 and cy46r1 for 2019. However, changes in meteorological drivers have relatively small effects on model results compared to changes in chemistry transport models and emission data.

The normalization procedures account for meteorological influences by using 2016-2019 meteorological data, particularly important given that many COMP4 Assessment Units are small and have elongated shapes. Transfer coefficients necessary for normalization are available at sufficiently fine resolution for these recent years.

While the context identifies meteorological changes affecting nitrogen deposition patterns and mentions investigating a possible climate change signal in atmospheric chemistry processes, the analysis focuses primarily on atmospheric nitrogen deposition rather than comprehensive climate change impacts. The meteorological variability represents a key factor requiring consideration when assessing long-term environmental trends in the North-East Atlantic Ocean region.",,"Recent meteorology (2016-2019) has been less favorable for oxidized nitrogen deposition compared to the meteorology of the 1990s, representing a possible climate change signal that requires further investigation. The normalization process shows normalized oxidized deposition values to OSPAR Region V in the 1990s are much smaller than actual values from that period, suggesting meteorological changes have reduced the efficiency of oxidized nitrogen transport and deposition.

Actual (non-normalized) contributions exhibit strong inter-annual variability due to meteorological changes, while normalized contributions better reflect changes in emissions and policy effects over the past 25 years. Weather-averaged depositions follow emission changes more accurately than actual depositions, indicating that meteorological variability significantly influences nitrogen deposition patterns in the OSPAR Maritime Area.

The normalization process now uses meteorological data from only 2016-2019, a reduction from previous reports that used more meteorological years. This change was necessary because calculations now consider more and smaller receptor areas, requiring transfer coefficients calculated on higher resolution grids for reliability.

Inter-annual variability in nitrogen depositions is large due to meteorological conditions, with significant year-to-year changes observed. For example, the 2018 report showed many more Exclusive Economic Zones had increased deposition compared to 1995, while the 2019 analysis showed different patterns, demonstrating substantial meteorological influence on deposition trends.

The EMEP MSC-W model accounts for meteorological processes including advection, turbulent diffusion, wet and dry depositions, using ECMWF IFS model data (cy40r1 for 1990-2018 and cy46r1 for 2019). Five-year averages are calculated to provide more robust results for changes since the 1990s, acknowledging that annual deposition values can change considerably due to meteorological variability.",,"The provided context does not address how climate change impacts species, habitats and ecosystems. Instead, the context consists entirely of technical data about atmospheric nitrogen deposition in the OSPAR Maritime Area from 1995-2019, focusing on oxidized and reduced nitrogen compounds measured through the EMEP MSC-W model.

The context contains one brief reference to climate change: recent meteorology from 2016-2019 has been less favorable for oxidized nitrogen deposition compared to the 1990s meteorology, which researchers aim to investigate as a possible climate change signal. However, this relates only to atmospheric deposition patterns, not to biological impacts on species, habitats, or ecosystems.

The document primarily presents quantitative analysis showing that oxidized nitrogen depositions have decreased significantly across all OSPAR regions since the 1990s, while reduced nitrogen decreases have been much smaller. Total nitrogen deposition trends are decreasing and statistically significant across all assessment units. The analysis covers five OSPAR regions, twenty-four exclusive economic zones, partial EEZs, and sixty-seven COMP4 assessment units, with detailed source apportionment data identifying contributing countries and sectors.

To answer the question about climate change impacts on marine species, habitats and ecosystems, different source material would be needed that specifically addresses biological and ecological responses to changing environmental conditions, rather than atmospheric chemistry and deposition modeling data.",,"Based on the provided OSPAR report context, there is one specific gap identified in relation to climate change. Recent meteorology from 2016-2019 has been less favorable for oxidized nitrogen deposition compared to the meteorology of the 1990s, which represents a possible climate change signal that requires further investigation. The researchers explicitly state they aim to investigate this potential climate change signal further, indicating this as a clear research gap.

The context reveals that normalized oxidized deposition to OSPAR Region V in the 1990s is much smaller than actual values when using recent meteorological data for normalization. This discrepancy suggests meteorological conditions affecting nitrogen deposition patterns may be changing over time, potentially due to climate change impacts.

Additionally, several methodological gaps emerge from the analysis that could affect climate change assessments. Some countries had not updated their emission data for particulate matter from the 1990s, limiting the ability to calculate complete trends back to 1990. The normalization procedure, which removes meteorological variability to better assess policy effectiveness, has been restricted to using only 2016-2019 meteorological data rather than longer time periods previously used, as more receptors are now considered requiring higher resolution calculations.

A detailed uncertainty analysis was beyond the scope of the current work, though this would be valuable for understanding confidence in climate-related trend assessments. The report notes that areas should extend over at least three model grid cells to give numerically stable results, which creates limitations for smaller assessment units.

The analysis shows large inter-annual variability in depositions due to meteorological conditions, with differences between individual years changing considerably from year to year, making five-year averages necessary for robust trend assessment. This variability complicates the detection of longer-term climate change signals in atmospheric deposition patterns.",,"Based on the EMEP MSC-W report on atmospheric nitrogen deposition to the OSPAR Maritime Area, there are limited explicit recommendations regarding climate change. However, the report does identify one specific area requiring further investigation.

The primary recommendation for further research concerns a potential climate change signal affecting nitrogen deposition patterns. Recent meteorology from 2016-2019 has been less favorable for oxidized nitrogen deposition compared to the meteorology of the 1990s. The report specifically states that investigators aim to investigate this possible climate change signal further.

This finding emerges from observations that normalized depositions of oxidized nitrogen to OSPAR Region V in the 1990s were much smaller than actual values, suggesting meteorological conditions may be changing in ways that affect atmospheric deposition patterns. The identification of this potential climate signal represents a gap in current understanding that requires additional research.

The report focuses primarily on documenting nitrogen deposition trends from 1995-2019 rather than making broad policy recommendations. While it acknowledges that changes in meteorological drivers have relatively small effects on model results compared to changes in chemistry transport models and emission data, the identified potential climate signal affecting deposition patterns represents the main climate-related research priority identified in the document.

Beyond this specific research need, the report does not provide comprehensive recommendations for climate change adaptation or mitigation strategies, focusing instead on technical aspects of atmospheric nitrogen monitoring and modeling.",,"The provided context contains only brief mentions of ocean acidification. Ocean acidification appears solely as part of the resilience goal for the North-East Atlantic Ocean, mentioned alongside climate change as environmental pressures the ocean should be resilient to.

The entire document focuses exclusively on atmospheric nitrogen deposition to the OSPAR Maritime Area from 1995-2019. The report presents comprehensive data on oxidized and reduced nitrogen deposition patterns, emission trends from contracting parties, source-receptor relationships, and temporal changes across OSPAR regions, exclusive economic zones, and assessment units. Nitrogen deposition from oxidized sources decreased significantly (up to 57% in some regions), while reduced nitrogen showed smaller decreases or remained stable.

However, the document provides no scientific findings, data, measurements, trends, impacts, or analysis specifically related to ocean acidification. There are no discussions of pH levels, carbonate chemistry, CO2 absorption by seawater, effects on marine organisms, or any ocean acidification monitoring results. The context is entirely focused on atmospheric nitrogen pollution rather than ocean chemistry changes from carbon dioxide absorption.

The document cannot answer questions about ocean acidification beyond acknowledging it as an environmental concern that the North-East Atlantic Ocean should be resilient to, as stated in the organizational vision.",,"Based on the provided context, I cannot answer the question about how ocean acidification impacts species, habitats and ecosystems. The context consists entirely of technical information from OSPAR reports about atmospheric nitrogen deposition to marine waters, calculated using the EMEP MSC-W model for the period 1995-2019.

The context contains detailed data on oxidized and reduced nitrogen depositions across OSPAR regions, Exclusive Economic Zones, and assessment units, showing that oxidized nitrogen depositions decreased by 19-61% between 1995 and 2019 across all areas, while reduced nitrogen depositions increased in seven EEZs during the same period. The reports focus on emission trends from contracting parties, meteorological normalization of deposition data, and source apportionment analysis.

This document focuses exclusively on COVID-19's impacts on the marine and aquatic environment of the Northeast Atlantic Ocean during 2020-2021.

The only references to climate change appear as brief mentions of resilience goals, but no climate-related findings, data, or analysis are presented. Instead, the document examines three specific COVID-19-related impacts: single-use plastic pollution, changes in fishing and aquaculture activities, and reduced recreation and tourism.

The context reveals that COVID-19 containment measures led to a 6% fall in EU GDP, generating both beneficial and harmful environmental effects. Marine animals benefited from reduced noise pollution and decreased pollutants due to lower maritime activity. Reduced fishing activity between February and July 2020 allowed endangered marine species more time to reproduce, though long-term ecological benefits cannot be confirmed until stock assessments incorporate 2020 data. Tourism restrictions resulted in cleaner beaches globally and provided undisturbed nesting conditions for sea turtles.

Conversely, personal protective equipment usage increased dramatically, with single-use face masks and gloves contributing 105,000 additional tonnes of plastic waste during the first European COVID-19 wave (April-September 2020), representing an 80% increase. This equipment, found on beaches and in marine environments, creates both macro and microplastic pollution, with fish and birds ingesting materials and becoming physically entangled.

The document explicitly states it examines COVID-19 feedback loops in maritime economics rather than climate change impacts, making the available context insufficient to address questions about climate change specifically.",,"The provided context does not address threats or pressures specifically related to climate change. This document focuses exclusively on COVID-19's impacts on the Northeast Atlantic Ocean's marine environment and economy during 2020-2021.

The analysis examines three main economic drivers affected by the pandemic: single-use plastics, fisheries and aquaculture, and recreation and tourism activities. COVID-19 led to increased marine litter from personal protective equipment, with littered masks and gloves found on beaches, along coasts and in the sea. Fish and birds can ingest these soft plastics, and animals can become physically entangled. E-commerce growth generated an estimated 11,400 to 17,600 tonnes of additional plastic packaging from March to September 2020.

The pandemic caused a 17 percent drop in aquaculture sales volume and 18 percent drop in income, with shellfish suffering most. Fisheries targeting high-value species or selling to hospitality sectors were hardest hit. However, reduced fishing activity in 2020 may have produced long-term beneficial ecological effects on stocks and ecosystems, allowing endangered marine species more time to reproduce.

Reduced maritime and coastal tourism activities had several beneficial effects on wildlife. Marine animals benefited from breaks in noise and reduced pollutants. Limited human beach activity provided turtles time to incubate and hatch undisturbed. The worldwide decline in commercial shipping reduced noise pollution near ports and on the high seas, with reduced water traffic correlating to decreased stress hormones in whales.

While climate change is mentioned in passing, no specific climate-related threats, pressures, impacts, or data are presented in this COVID-19 focused analysis.",,"The provided context does not address how climate change impacts species, habitats and ecosystems. Instead, this document focuses exclusively on COVID-19's effects on the marine environment in the Northeast Atlantic Ocean during 2020.

The context examines three specific areas of COVID-19 impact: single-use plastics, fisheries and aquaculture, and recreation and tourism activities. Regarding species impacts, reduced fishing activity between February and July 2020 allowed endangered marine species more time to reproduce, with fish populations and other marine creatures recovering faster during the COVID-19 lockdown. The worldwide decline in commercial shipping activities reduced noise pollution near ports and on the high seas, benefiting marine animals. Restricted water flow was directly related to reduced stress hormones in whales. Limited human activity on beaches provided turtles sufficient time to incubate and hatch undisturbed.

However, negative impacts also occurred. Fish and birds can ingest discarded personal protective equipment like masks and gloves, while animals can become physically entangled in this plastic waste. Discarded protection equipment represents an additional source of microplastic pollution to ecosystems and aquatic environments, with plastic fragments smaller than 5 centimeters affecting marine systems.

The reduction in fishing led to potential long-term beneficial ecological effects on stocks and ecosystems, though this cannot be confirmed until stock assessments incorporate data from 2020 and subsequent years. Marine animals benefited from reduced noise and pollutants during this period.

While climate change and ocean acidification are mentioned once as resilience challenges, no specific impacts of climate change on species, habitats, or ecosystems are analyzed or discussed in this COVID-19 focused report.",,"Based on the provided context, there are no specific mentions of gaps in relation to climate change.

The only reference to climate change appears in a brief organizational statement about resilience to climate change and ocean acidification, but this contains no analysis of gaps or specific climate-related findings.

The document thoroughly examines COVID-19's effects across three main areas: single-use plastics (including a 105,000-tonne increase in personal protective equipment during the first European wave, representing an 80% increase), fisheries and aquaculture (with 17% drops in aquaculture sales volumes), and recreation/tourism activities. Complex feedback loops between economic activity and social-ecological impacts are identified as important factors requiring systematic data gathering for future economic models.

However, the document acknowledges significant knowledge limitations. Stock assessments cannot prove beneficial ecological effects from reduced fishing until data from 2020 and following years becomes available. The long-term economic impact of COVID-19 remains unknown despite member states' mitigation efforts. The analysis is based on preliminary information and stresses that COVID-19-related information should be gathered systematically for future economic models.

While the document identifies these knowledge gaps and data limitations related to COVID-19's environmental and economic impacts, it does not address any gaps specifically related to climate change research, monitoring, or understanding within the OSPAR context.",,"The provided context does not contain specific recommendations regarding climate change, nor does it identify issues requiring further investigation or research related to climate change. The document focuses entirely on COVID-19 impacts on the marine and aquatic environment of the OSPAR maritime area, examining three main economic drivers: single-use plastics, fisheries and aquaculture, and recreation and tourism activities.

The context reveals that COVID-19 created temporary beneficial effects for marine wildlife through reduced human activities. Marine animals benefited from decreased noise and reduced pollutants during lockdowns. Turtles had undisturbed time to incubate and hatch on beaches with limited human activity. Reduced fishing activity in 2020 potentially provided long-term beneficial ecological effects to stocks and ecosystems, allowing endangered marine species more time to reproduce, though this cannot be proven until stock assessments are updated with 2020 data and following years.

The analysis identified several complex feedback loops influencing direct economic activity in the short term and indirectly through social and ecological impacts in the longer term.

All other assessments,Impacts on ecosystem services,OK,impacts_on_ecosystems_services_report,"The OSPAR report identifies climate change as a significant driver affecting marine ecosystems and a strategic priority requiring multiple response approaches. Climate change degrades natural resources, reduces biodiversity, and negatively affects human physical well-being alongside other environmental pressures.

Marine ecosystems play a crucial role in global climate regulation through several mechanisms. They regulate atmospheric and oceanic chemical composition by accumulating and retaining carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases like methane and nitrous oxide, while controlling heat and moisture transfer. These processes directly influence climate parameters including temperature, rainfall patterns, and wind, providing habitable ambient environments for humans.

Specific biological processes contribute to climate regulation. Photosynthetic organisms, including aquatic plants and phytoplankton, remove atmospheric CO2 through sequestration in primary production and consumption. Marine bacteria reduce methane levels originating from the ocean floor before atmospheric release. Large marine mammals accumulate significant carbon in their bodies, with carcasses locking organic carbon on the sea floor after death. Whales also increase primary productivity, influencing carbon fluxes throughout marine ecosystems. Zooplankton contributes through particle export via grazing, fractioning of sinking particles, and transporting particulate organic carbon to depth through vertical migration.

However, climate change impacts on marine mammals exist but cannot be precisely quantified due to variables including regional scale and functional groups. Environmental state changes associated with climate change may require new aquaculture varieties better suited to changing conditions, highlighting the importance of genetic material provision by marine organisms.

The report notes that estimating impact magnitudes remains difficult due to limited scientific literature, demonstrating gaps in understanding causality linkages between climate change and ecosystem service provision.",,"The context addresses climate change threats and pressures primarily in relation to adaptation and mitigation strategies, but provides limited specific detail about the actual threats themselves.

Climate change impacts on marine mammals exist but remain poorly quantified. Experts report that climate change affects mammals, though the exact quantification of this impact is unknown and depends on variables such as regional scale and functional groups. The framework acknowledges climate change and ocean acidification as pressures requiring strategic responses through monitoring, analysis, and communication of their effects.

The context identifies ocean acidification alongside climate change as a key pressure, with strategic objectives calling for enhanced ecosystem resilience and adaptation measures. The framework emphasizes facilitating adaptation by considering additional pressures when developing management programmes and measures.

Marine ecosystem services face disruption from climate-related environmental state changes. For aquaculture systems, climate change necessitates using new varieties better suited to altered environmental conditions, highlighting the importance of genetic material provision by marine organisms for future human welfare. The marine ecosystem's role in climate regulation through carbon sequestration becomes crucial for mitigation efforts, with strategies focusing on protecting carbon storage habitats like seagrass beds, kelp forests, and saltmarshes.

The methodology reveals that climate change, along with natural resource degradation, biodiversity loss, and chemical contamination, negatively affects physical well-being. However, the context emphasizes that linking climate change impacts to specific ecosystem service disruptions requires better quantification of causality relationships.

The broader framework positions climate change as both a driver of ecosystem state changes and a pressure requiring ecosystem-based management responses, though specific mechanistic details about climate threats remain largely unspecified in the available context.",,"Climate change impacts on marine species, habitats and ecosystems through multiple pathways that alter fundamental biological processes and ecosystem functions. Physical damage and death of organisms occur directly, but climate change also alters critical behaviors including feeding patterns, reproductive behavior, fertility, reproductive success, and mobility of marine species.

Marine mammals experience documented impacts from climate change, though exact quantification remains unknown and varies by regional scale and functional groups. Large marine mammals like whales contribute significantly to climate regulation through carbon accumulation in their bodies, with carcasses locking substantial organic carbon on the sea floor after death.

Climate change affects aquaculture species selection, as varieties currently used for productivity may become unsuitable under changing environmental conditions. New varieties better adapted to altered environmental states may become essential in the near future, highlighting the importance of genetic diversity in ecosystem services provision.

Temperature changes, ocean acidification, and altered chemical composition of atmosphere and oceans affect local and global climate parameters including temperature, rainfall patterns, and wind. These changes impact the marine ecosystem's ability to regulate climate through accumulation and retention of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, while controlling heat and moisture transfer.

Habitat loss occurs through climate-induced changes, leading to displacement of species from breeding, nursery, and feeding areas. This displacement increases energy expenditure in affected individuals, negatively impacting survival, reproduction, and fitness. Changes in species distribution result from behavioral alterations including modifications to diving, swimming, migration routes, breathing patterns, and resting behaviors.

Climate change disrupts marine food webs by affecting nutrient cycling and primary production processes. Changes in primary producer communities create cascade effects throughout entire food webs, altering the fundamental structure and functioning of marine ecosystems. The provision of ecosystem services becomes compromised as supporting ecological processes are disrupted.",,"Based on the OSPAR reports, several significant gaps exist in relation to climate change assessment and ecosystem services:

**Data and Quantification Gaps**
Experts reported extreme difficulty estimating the magnitude of state change impacts on ecosystem services due to limited scientific information and evidence. The methodology relies on qualitative information because of the current lack of quantitative data regarding marine ecosystem services provision and changes resulting from marine state change impacts, particularly at the North-East Atlantic scale. Climate change impacts on marine mammals are recognized, but exact quantification remains unknown, varying by regional scale and functional groups.

**Scientific Knowledge Limitations** 
Limited information exists in scientific literature about causality linkages between state changes and ecosystem services, demonstrating how little is known about these relationships. Regional differences within the OSPAR maritime area may influence ecosystem service provision levels and impact magnitudes due to varying ecological characteristics between geographical areas, but this spatial variation is poorly understood.

**Methodological Gaps**
Current approaches cannot estimate impact sizes on ecosystem services due to insufficient scientific evidence. Future improvements require integrating quantitative information on ecosystem service provision impacts, potentially through economic valuation and Natural Capital Accounting integration. Spatial approaches are needed to differentiate between areas with varying ecosystem service provision and impact magnitudes.

**Assessment Integration Challenges**
The reports identify gaps in understanding drivers of change and how human activities and pressures affect ecosystems. Carbon storage represents one ecosystem service that could be more easily quantified and has high policy visibility, suggesting potential for targeted case studies to address methodological limitations.",,"OSPAR recommends developing a regional approach to applying nature-based solutions for carbon storage by 2025, with specific measures to protect and restore carbon sequestration and storage habitats including seagrass beds, kelp forests and saltmarshes. This represents their primary climate mitigation strategy focused on safeguarding the marine environment's role as a natural carbon store.

For climate adaptation, OSPAR recommends facilitating adaptation to climate change and ocean acidification impacts by considering additional pressures when developing programmes, actions and measures. They also emphasize raising awareness through monitoring, analyzing and communicating climate change and ocean acidification effects, and restoring degraded habitats to safeguard ecosystem function and resilience to these pressures.

Several areas require further investigation and research. Climate change impacts on marine mammals need quantification, as experts reported that while impacts exist, exact quantification remains unknown and depends on variables like regional scale and functional groups. The development of aquaculture varieties better suited to changing environmental conditions associated with climate change requires attention, highlighting the importance of genetic material provision by marine organisms.

Research gaps include refining methodologies for assessing climate change impacts on marine ecosystem services through quantitative information integration and economic valuation of ecosystem service flows. Spatial approaches allowing regional differentiation need development. Future work should explore links between ecosystem services and human activities within the DAPSIR framework, particularly how climate-related ecosystem service changes affect socio-economic drivers and activities. The integration of Natural Capital Accounting approaches requires expansion to better quantify climate regulation services and carbon storage benefits, which are more easily quantifiable than other ecosystem services and have high policy visibility for supporting climate-related decision-making.",,"Ocean acidification is identified as a significant environmental challenge requiring strategic action, with OSPAR establishing specific objectives to address its impacts. Strategic objective 10 focuses on raising awareness through monitoring, analyzing and communicating the effects of ocean acidification. Strategic objective 11 aims to facilitate adaptation by considering additional pressures when developing programmes and measures. Strategic objective 12 seeks to mitigate ocean acidification by contributing to global efforts and safeguarding the marine environment's role as a natural carbon store.

The marine ecosystem provides crucial climate regulation services that directly relate to ocean acidification processes. Marine calcifying organisms lock away calcium carbonate, contributing to CO2 removal from both ocean and atmosphere. Photosynthetic organisms remove CO2 through sequestration in primary production and consumption processes. Marine organisms act as carbon sinks, facilitating carbon burial in seabed sediments, while bacteria reduce methane levels originating from the ocean.

Water quality regulation processes specifically address acidification through control and buffering of water acidification by marine life forms, alongside nutrient uptake by aquatic plants and microbial organisms. Zooplankton play a crucial role in the oceanic biological carbon pump through particle export via grazing, fractioning of sinking particles, and transport of particulate organic carbon through vertical migration, all contributing to atmospheric CO2 regulation.

The QSR 2023 includes assessment of climate change and ocean acidification impacts as a key evaluation component. However, quantitative data regarding ocean acidification's specific impacts on marine ecosystem services provision remains limited, particularly at the North-East Atlantic scale, representing a significant knowledge gap requiring further research and monitoring efforts.",,"The provided context does not contain specific information about how ocean acidification impacts species, habitats and ecosystems. While ocean acidification is mentioned multiple times throughout the document as a strategic concern alongside climate change, the context focuses primarily on impacts from marine litter and marine mammal population changes rather than acidification effects.

The context does reveal that ocean acidification is recognized as a significant threat requiring management action. Strategic objectives acknowledge the need to restore degraded habitats to safeguard their resilience to ocean acidification, facilitate adaptation to acidification impacts, raise awareness through monitoring and analysis, and mitigate acidification by protecting marine carbon storage capabilities.

The document mentions that water quality regulation services include ""control and buffering of water acidification by marine life forms"" through marine ecosystem capture processes, indicating that marine organisms naturally help buffer acidification effects. However, no specific details are provided about how acidification stress affects these buffering organisms or other marine life.

The extensive discussion of ecosystem impacts focuses on physical damage, habitat loss, behavioral alterations, reproductive success changes, and food web disruptions - but these are attributed to marine litter, noise, pollutants, and mammal population declines rather than acidification. The methodology described assesses state changes and ecosystem service impacts generally, but the specific case studies examined (marine litter and marine mammals) do not address acidification effects on species survival, habitat degradation, or ecosystem functioning. The context acknowledges acidification as a strategic priority requiring resilience-building measures but lacks the scientific detail needed to explain its specific biological and ecological impacts.",,10,7,25
All other assessments,Impacts of marine litter on biota in the OSPAR maritime area,OK,p00888_marine_litter_biota_harm_review,"The provided context contains extremely limited information about climate change. Marine litter has become a major stressor adding to existing human pressures on the marine environment, which include global warming and ocean acidification alongside overfishing, bycatch, and underwater noise. These multiple stressors act in concert and cumulatively, making it difficult to monitor and quantify adverse effects on marine species and populations.

The context notes that ecosystem and population effects from marine litter are available but limited, partly because such effects are difficult to quantify, especially when combined with other anthropogenic pressures including climate-related impacts.

However, this report focuses almost entirely on marine litter impacts on marine wildlife and ecosystems in the OSPAR region. The context provided does not contain substantive climate change findings, data, or analysis. The document appears to be a comprehensive review of marine litter effects on various species including seabirds, marine mammals, fish, and invertebrates, with detailed findings on plastic ingestion rates, microplastic contamination, and entanglement impacts. Climate change is only mentioned peripherally as one of several existing human pressures on marine environments, without specific temperature data, sea level information, ecosystem responses to warming, or other climate-related metrics and impacts that would typically comprise a climate change analysis.",,"The provided context primarily focuses on marine litter impacts rather than climate change threats specifically. However, climate change pressures are mentioned briefly as part of the broader environmental stressor context.

Global warming and ocean acidification are identified as existing human pressures on the marine environment alongside marine litter, overfishing, bycatch, and underwater noise. Marine litter adds to these existing climate-related stressors, creating cumulative impacts on marine ecosystems.

The context indicates that multiple stressors act in concert and cumulatively on marine species, making it difficult to monitor and quantify adverse effects at individual, species, or population levels. Climate change pressures are mentioned specifically in relation to marine mammal strandings, where global warming effects interact with other factors including parasitism, anthropogenic contaminants, biotoxins, competing habitat uses, and prey depletion.

One example demonstrates how climate effects interact with other stressors: Northern Fulmars experienced prolonged food shortage that interacted with marine litter impacts. After a long period of population growth, the population trend stopped or reversed since the late 1990s, with poor reproductive success often observed. Cumulative stressors, which would include climate effects, are interacting to reduce adult survival.

The context establishes that effects are difficult to quantify when multiple anthropogenic pressures combine, but does not provide detailed analysis of specific climate change mechanisms, impacts, or projections. The focus remains predominantly on marine litter as an additional stressor layered onto existing climate pressures rather than examining climate change threats in detail. The limited climate change information available suggests these pressures contribute to the overall degradation of marine ecosystems alongside the extensively documented marine litter impacts.",,"The provided context does not address the specific question about how climate change impacts species, habitats and ecosystems. The context consists entirely of technical information from OSPAR reports focused on marine litter impacts on marine life, including ingestion of plastics by seabirds, entanglement of marine mammals, microplastic uptake by benthic invertebrates, and effects on various marine species from debris.

While the context briefly mentions climate change alongside other stressors like ""global warming, ocean acidification, overfishing, bycatch, underwater noise,"" it provides no analysis, data, or findings about climate change impacts themselves. The documents appear to be specialized reports on marine litter rather than climate change assessments.

The context does demonstrate how multiple stressors affect marine ecosystems - showing that marine litter has become a major stressor affecting 914 species through entanglement and ingestion as of 2020, with plastic ingestion predicted to increase from 29% to 99% of seabird species by 2050. Various studies document impacts including mortality rates of 0-22% in stranded cetaceans due to marine litter, increased gannet mortality rates from 0.5% to 4-8% annually due to entanglement, and adverse effects on feeding behavior, growth, development, reproduction and lifespan across 39 zooplankton taxa. However, these findings relate to marine litter impacts rather than climate change effects.

To answer the question about climate change impacts on species, habitats and ecosystems, different OSPAR reports focused specifically on climate change would be needed.",,"The OSPAR report acknowledges climate change as part of the broader environmental context but reveals significant gaps in addressing its interactions with marine litter impacts. Marine litter is identified as adding to existing human pressures including global warming, ocean acidification, overfishing, bycatch, and underwater noise, yet the report demonstrates limited integration of climate considerations into marine litter assessment frameworks.

A fundamental gap exists in quantifying ecosystem or population effects from marine litter, particularly when combined with other anthropogenic pressures including climate change. The report states that such effects are difficult to quantify, especially in combination with these other stressors, indicating insufficient methodological approaches for assessing cumulative impacts where climate change intersects with marine litter effects.

Evidence for ecosystem-level impacts remains limited across the OSPAR region. While individual species effects from marine litter ingestion and entanglement are documented, population-level consequences are poorly understood, and the compounding effects of climate stressors are not systematically evaluated. The report notes that monitoring and quantifying adverse effects from multiple stressors acting in concert and cumulatively is difficult on species, population, and individual levels.

Detection and quantification methods for marine litter impacts lack reproducibility and standardization, creating additional gaps in understanding how these impacts interact with climate-driven changes in marine ecosystems. The relatively small number of standardized protocols applied contrasts with numerous case studies, limiting the ability to assess how climate change might modify marine litter impact patterns.

Seasonal differences in microplastic concentrations are noted in some studies, suggesting climate-driven temporal variations exist but are inadequately characterized. The spatial patterns of contamination documented do not systematically account for climate change influences on distribution and exposure pathways.",,"The provided context does not contain specific recommendations related to climate change itself. While the context acknowledges climate change as part of the broader environmental challenges facing marine ecosystems, it focuses almost exclusively on marine litter impacts rather than climate change recommendations.

The document identifies marine litter as ""another severe impact to existing human pressures on the marine environment such as global warming, ocean acidification, overfishing, bycatch, underwater noise and others."" However, the recommendations and research needs outlined are specifically directed toward marine litter monitoring and assessment rather than climate change adaptation or mitigation.

The research gaps and recommendations identified include: harmonizing and standardizing protocols for analyzing marine litter in stranded organisms to reduce analysis costs; reinforcing national stranding networks for sample collection; quantifying actual effects of marine litter on organisms; developing methods to determine population-level effects of marine litter ingestion and entanglement for cetaceans; creating standardized protocols for necropsies; establishing monitoring procedures that differentiate between acute and chronic effects on biota; and developing new indicators for microplastic ingestion by fish and microplastics in sediments.

The context notes that ecosystem or population effects are difficult to quantify, especially when combined with other anthropogenic pressures, and that stressors act in concert and cumulatively. However, these observations relate to marine litter impacts rather than climate change specifically. The document does not provide climate change recommendations or identify climate-related research needs beyond this general acknowledgment of cumulative pressures.",,"The provided context contains very limited information about ocean acidification specifically. Ocean acidification is only mentioned as one of several existing human pressures on the marine environment alongside global warming, overfishing, bycatch, and underwater noise. The report identifies marine litter as adding ""another severe impact"" to these existing stressors, with ocean acidification listed as part of the cumulative pressures affecting marine wildlife and ecosystems.

Ocean acidification is also referenced as one of the environmental challenges that the North-East Atlantic Ocean needs to be resilient to, mentioned alongside climate change in the context of achieving a clean, healthy and biologically diverse marine environment.

However, the document does not provide any specific data, findings, or analysis about ocean acidification itself. There are no measurements of pH changes, impacts on marine species, regional variations, or projections related to acidification in the OSPAR Maritime Area. The report does not discuss acidification's effects on calcifying organisms, coral reefs, or other typically vulnerable marine life.

The context is primarily focused on marine litter impacts, with ocean acidification serving only as background context for the broader suite of environmental pressures. The document's 147 studies and extensive analysis concentrate on ingestion, entanglement, and other impacts of marine debris on marine life, rather than addressing ocean acidification as a primary concern.

To obtain comprehensive information about ocean acidification findings, a different OSPAR report specifically focused on ocean chemistry, climate impacts, or acidification monitoring would be needed.",,"Based on the provided context, there is insufficient information to comprehensively address how ocean acidification impacts species, habitats and ecosystems. The context primarily focuses on marine litter impacts rather than ocean acidification effects.

Ocean acidification is mentioned only as one of several existing human pressures on marine environments, alongside global warming, overfishing, bycatch, and underwater noise. The context identifies it as a stressor that marine ecosystems need resilience against, but provides no specific data, findings, or analysis about its impacts on marine life.

The available context extensively documents marine litter impacts instead, showing that 914 species are affected through entanglement and ingestion, with documented effects including reduced growth rates, reproductive output, mortality, and population-level consequences. Marine litter causes smothering of benthic habitats, alters benthic community structures, leads to biodiversity loss, and creates cumulative stress effects when acting in concert with other anthropogenic pressures including ocean acidification.

While the context acknowledges that multiple stressors including ocean acidification act cumulatively and make monitoring individual effects difficult, it contains no specific scientific findings, data points, or detailed analysis regarding ocean acidification's direct or indirect impacts on species, habitats, or ecosystem functioning. The document appears to be a comprehensive review of marine litter impacts rather than a study of ocean acidification effects.",,2,2,5
All other assessments,Impacts of the offshore oil and gas industry,OK,p00904_oic_overall_assessment_impacts_offshore_activities,"OSPAR has committed to conducting comprehensive climate change assessments every six years, beginning in 2023, to evaluate current and projected impacts of climate change and ocean acidification on the OSPAR Maritime Area and its uses. These assessments will inform the development of national and international actions.

Climate change and ocean acidification are creating additional pressures on marine pollution prevention efforts. OSPAR is reviewing and updating its measures and actions relevant to offshore oil and gas industry pollution prevention specifically to address these additional climate-related pressures.

Regarding atmospheric emissions from offshore oil and gas operations, CO2 emissions decreased by 33% over the 2009-2019 period, with overall reductions reported across all atmospheric emissions, most significantly in methane and SO2. The contribution of offshore oil and gas to national CO2 emissions varies considerably among member states - from 0.001-0.2% for countries with small offshore industries like Spain, Germany and Ireland, to 35.5% for Norway and 3.4% for the United Kingdom.

Carbon dioxide storage in geological formations has emerged as a climate mitigation activity. Two large-scale CO2 storage projects currently operate in the OSPAR Maritime Area. By 2024, OSPAR will review monitoring results to assess whether techniques adequately demonstrate permanent CO2 retention in storage complexes. By 2026, OSPAR will evaluate the effectiveness of measures ensuring permanent storage without significant adverse consequences for the marine environment.

OSPAR is developing methods to analyze cumulative effects in marine ecosystems by 2028, incorporating spatial and temporal information on human activities, pressures, sensitive receptors and habitats to inform management measures addressing climate-related impacts.",,"The provided context indicates that climate change and ocean acidification represent significant emerging threats and pressures in the OSPAR Maritime Area, though limited specific details are given about their impacts.

OSPAR has established a commitment to assess current and projected impacts of climate change and ocean acidification on the OSPAR Maritime Area every six years starting in 2023, using these assessments to inform national and international action development. The reports acknowledge the need for marine ecosystems to be resilient to climate change and ocean acidification pressures.

The context reveals that OSPAR will undertake reviews of existing measures and actions relevant to pollution prevention, specifically updating these ""in the context of additional pressures from climate change and ocean acidification."" This indicates climate change creates additional pressure layers that compound existing environmental stresses.

Carbon dioxide storage emerges as both a climate mitigation activity and potential pressure source. Two large-scale CO2 storage projects currently operate in the OSPAR Maritime Area. However, risks exist from potential CO2 leakage from storage sites, which may negatively affect marine environment receptors if leakage occurs. Scientific knowledge of environmental risks from geological CO2 storage continues developing, with identified needs to improve environmental monitoring reporting from storage projects.

OSPAR has established monitoring and evaluation frameworks for 2024 and 2026 to assess whether monitoring techniques adequately demonstrate permanent CO2 stream retention in storage complexes and evaluate measure effectiveness in preventing significant adverse consequences for marine environment, human health, and maritime area uses.

The context also mentions cumulative effects analysis development by 2028, incorporating spatial and temporal information on human activities, pressures, sensitive receptors and habitats to inform impact management measures, suggesting climate pressures will be considered alongside other anthropogenic stresses.",,"The provided context does not contain specific information about how climate change impacts species, habitats and ecosystems. The context primarily focuses on impacts from offshore oil and gas industry activities rather than climate change effects.

The only direct references to climate change are procedural mentions that OSPAR will assess current and projected impacts of climate change and ocean acidification on the OSPAR Maritime Area every 6 years starting in 2023, and that measures will be reviewed in the context of additional pressures from climate change and ocean acidification. However, no actual findings about these impacts are presented.

Instead, the context extensively documents impacts from industrial activities on marine life. Cold water corals and sponges are vulnerable to physical disturbance and particle exposure, requiring many years to re-establish. Arctic seasonal aggregations of marine mammals in sea ice areas, seabirds at breeding colonies, and fish at spawning grounds are identified as particularly vulnerable to disturbances. Benthic communities show gradual species composition changes when impacted, with soft sediment fauna re-colonising within 1-2 years, while harder substrate communities may take up to 10 years to recover in deeper, colder waters. PAH contaminants induce cardiac defects in fish fry, reducing swimming performance, prey capture, and prey avoidance with survival implications. Platform lighting attracts migratory birds during autumn migration and poor weather, causing some mortality.

To answer the specific question about climate change impacts on species, habitats and ecosystems, different source material containing climate-specific research and findings would be required.",,"OSPAR reports identify several significant gaps related to climate change in the marine environment:

**Assessment and Monitoring Gaps:**
OSPAR will assess current and projected impacts of climate change and ocean acidification on the Maritime Area every 6 years starting in 2023, indicating this comprehensive assessment framework is not yet established. Current measures and actions relevant to pollution prevention require review and updating to address additional pressures from climate change and ocean acidification.

**Methodological Development Needs:**
Methods for analyzing cumulative effects in North-East Atlantic marine ecosystems need further development by 2028, specifically incorporating spatial and temporal information on human activities, pressures, sensitive receptors and habitats in the context of climate impacts.

**Carbon Dioxide Storage Knowledge Gaps:**
Scientific knowledge of environmental risks from carbon dioxide storage in geological formations is still developing. The need to improve and refine reporting on environmental monitoring from CO2 storage projects has been identified. By 2024, OSPAR will review monitoring results to assess whether current techniques adequately demonstrate permanent carbon dioxide retention, with effectiveness evaluation scheduled for 2026.

**Risk Assessment Limitations:**
Linking estimated risk levels to actual impacts in receiving environments remains unaddressed. The causality between biomarkers and toxic effects at organism and population levels requires proof, with other anthropogenic factors difficult to exclude when assessing impacts in marine ecosystems.

**Coordinated Monitoring Requirements:**
Effective, coordinated environmental monitoring programs to evaluate regional effects are needed by 2028, including ecosystem effects, indicating current monitoring lacks sufficient coordination and scope for climate-related impacts assessment.",,"OSPAR's climate change recommendations center on a systematic 6-yearly assessment cycle beginning in 2023 to evaluate current and projected impacts of climate change and ocean acidification on the OSPAR Maritime Area and its uses, with findings intended to inform national and international action development.

A key requirement involves reviewing and updating all OSPAR measures and actions relevant to pollution prevention to address additional pressures from climate change and ocean acidification. This reflects recognition that existing frameworks require adaptation to climate-related stressors.

The reports identify several critical research gaps requiring investigation. Methods for analyzing cumulative effects in North-East Atlantic marine ecosystems must be developed by 2028, incorporating spatial and temporal data on human activities, pressures, sensitive receptors, and habitats to inform management measures. Currently, linking estimated risk levels from risk-based approaches to actual impacts in receiving environments remains unaddressed, representing a significant knowledge gap.

Carbon dioxide storage presents emerging climate-related challenges requiring investigation. Scientific knowledge of environmental risks from geological CO2 storage continues developing, necessitating improved environmental monitoring and reporting protocols. By 2024, OSPAR will review monitoring techniques to ensure adequate demonstration of permanent CO2 stream retention in storage complexes. By 2026, effectiveness evaluation of measures ensuring permanent retention without adverse marine environmental consequences is required.

Additional research needs include establishing relationships between biomarker-level effects and organism/population-level impacts in marine ecosystems. Causality between biomarkers, toxic effects, and broader ecological impacts remains unproven, with anthropogenic factors complicating impact assessments.

Environmental monitoring programs for offshore activities must be developed to evaluate regional ecosystem effects by 2028. The development requires consistent, evidence-based guidance where current approaches vary significantly across the OSPAR area, reflecting inadequate scientific foundation for management decisions.",,"Based on the provided context, ocean acidification is mentioned in limited but specific ways within the OSPAR reports.

OSPAR has established Assessment Strategy S10.O3, which mandates that in 2023 and every six years thereafter, assessments will evaluate current and projected impacts of both climate change and ocean acidification on the OSPAR Maritime Area and its uses. These assessments are designed to inform the development of national and international actions.

The reports indicate that ocean acidification represents additional pressures alongside climate change that must be considered when reviewing OSPAR measures and actions relevant to pollution prevention. Specifically, Task S12.O4 requires undertaking a review of OSPAR measures and actions to update them appropriately in the context of these additional pressures from climate change and ocean acidification.

However, the provided context does not contain specific findings, data, or detailed analysis about ocean acidification itself. The document does not present measurements of pH changes, impacts on marine organisms, acidification rates, or regional variations in acidification within the OSPAR Maritime Area. The references to ocean acidification appear to be primarily procedural, establishing future assessment requirements rather than reporting current scientific findings.

The context focuses predominantly on offshore oil and gas industry impacts, chemical discharges, and carbon dioxide storage in geological formations, with ocean acidification mentioned only as a future assessment priority and contextual pressure to consider in policy reviews. The scientific substance regarding ocean acidification impacts, trends, or specific effects on North-East Atlantic marine ecosystems is not available in the provided text.",,"Based on the provided context, there is extremely limited information specifically about ocean acidification's impacts on species, habitats, and ecosystems.

The context indicates that OSPAR will assess impacts of climate change and ocean acidification on the Maritime Area in 2023 and every six years thereafter to inform development of actions. It also states that measures and actions relevant to pollution prevention will be updated considering additional pressures from climate change and ocean acidification. Carbon dioxide storage is mentioned as requiring environmental monitoring to ensure streams are retained permanently in geological formations without adverse consequences for the marine environment.

However, the context contains extensive information about impacts from other pressures, particularly offshore oil and gas activities. These show various ways marine systems can be affected: reduced biodiversity near platforms, impacts on sensitive benthic fauna like cold water corals and sponges, effects on fish through PAH contamination causing cardiac defects and reduced swimming performance, biomarker responses in marine organisms, and localized physical impacts on seabed communities. Deep sea cold water corals and sponges are identified as particularly vulnerable to disturbance and requiring many years to re-establish.

The context demonstrates that the OSPAR Maritime Area supports high biodiversity, important spawning areas, and sensitive ecosystems, but does not provide the specific information needed to comprehensively answer how ocean acidification impacts these systems. The scientific analysis of ocean acidification effects on species, habitats, and ecosystems is not present in this context.",,4,3,22
All other assessments,Integrated biological effects and chemical contaminants approach: a case study,OK,p00899_int_bio_effects_qsr23,"Based on the provided OSPAR report context, climate change is mentioned only briefly and primarily in the context of combined environmental pressures rather than as a standalone focus.

The report identifies climate change as one of multiple stressors affecting marine organisms in the OSPAR Maritime Area. Specifically, in the Oslofjord case study examining cod population decline, researchers acknowledge that ""the combination of various anthropogenic and climatic pressures cannot be excluded"" when assessing impacts on cod health and population status. However, the analysis concludes that biological effects from long-term chemical exposure appear to be the primary driver of the observed cod population decline, rather than climatic factors.

The report emphasizes the critical need to ""understand how organisms cope with chemical exposure stress in a context of global change,"" highlighting that marine organisms face multiple simultaneous stressors including both chemical contamination and climate-related pressures.

Additionally, climate change appears in OSPAR's stated vision for ""a clean, healthy and biologically diverse North-East Atlantic Ocean, which is productive, used sustainably and resilient to climate change and ocean acidification,"" though this organizational statement is not part of the scientific findings.

The document's primary focus is on chemical contamination effects rather than climate impacts. The integrated biological effects monitoring approach described throughout the report specifically targets chemical contaminants and their biological impacts on marine species across the North-East Atlantic, with climate change mentioned only as an acknowledged co-stressor requiring consideration in comprehensive environmental assessments. No specific climate change data, trends, or detailed climate impact analysis is provided in the available context.",,"Based on the provided context, climate change is mentioned only briefly as one of several pressures affecting marine organisms, but it is not the primary focus of analysis in these OSPAR reports.

The context acknowledges that ""various anthropogenic and climatic pressures cannot be excluded"" when examining the decline of cod populations in the Oslofjord, alongside chemical contamination effects. However, the analysis concludes that ""the biological effects of long-term chemical exposure appear to be one of the main sources of the perceived decline of the cod population,"" suggesting climate pressures are considered secondary to chemical impacts in this specific case.

The reports emphasize the critical need to ""understand how organisms cope with chemical exposure stress in a context of global change"" and assess biological effects of chemical mixtures on organisms across the North-East Atlantic. This indicates recognition that climate change provides an important environmental context that may interact with chemical contamination, but the specific mechanisms or impacts are not detailed.

The context reveals that monitoring programs focus extensively on chemical contamination effects through biomarkers, with assessment of various toxicity mechanisms including carcinogenicity, genotoxicity, endocrine disruption, and other impacts on biological functions like growth, reproduction, immune responses, and disease progression. Fish Disease Index monitoring shows worsening health status at multiple stations, but attribution to climate versus chemical factors is not specified.

The provided context is insufficient to comprehensively answer questions about climate change threats and pressures, as the reports concentrate primarily on chemical contamination monitoring and biological effects assessment rather than climate-related impacts on marine ecosystems.",,"The provided context does not directly address how climate change impacts species, habitats and ecosystems. The OSPAR report context focuses primarily on chemical contamination effects and biological monitoring of marine organisms rather than climate change impacts.

The context contains only two brief references to climate: a mention of resilience to climate change as a goal for the North-East Atlantic Ocean, and one statement that ""the combination of various anthropogenic and climatic pressures cannot be excluded in the Oslofjord"" regarding cod population decline, though this acknowledges climatic pressures without detailing specific impacts.

Instead, the context extensively documents chemical stress impacts on marine life. In the Seine estuary, mussels and flatfishes showed genotoxicity, neurotoxicity, and cytotoxicity from chemical exposure in 2018. Different species demonstrate varying abilities to cope with chemical stress - sole appears more sensitive than other species in contaminated areas. The Oslofjord cod population shows chronic chemical impacts on metabolic adaptability, with biomarkers confirming chemical exposure as a main source of perceived population decline since 2010.

The monitoring data spans multiple species including cod, herring, sole, eelpout, whiting, saithe, mussels, flounder, dab, and gastropods across locations from Iceland to Spain. Tributyltin has caused fertility and calcification problems in oysters and imposex in gastropod snails since the 1970s, leading to population declines. Various biomarkers measure DNA damage, metabolic stress, neurotoxicity, and disease indices in these sentinel species.

While the context demonstrates sophisticated biological effects monitoring across the North-East Atlantic, it lacks the specific climate change impact data needed to answer the question comprehensively.",,"Based on the provided context, several specific gaps are identified in relation to climate change:

First, there is a critical need to understand how organisms cope with chemical exposure stress in the context of global change. The report emphasizes it is crucial to assess the biological effects of chemical mixtures on organisms living in large geographic areas while considering global change pressures.

The context acknowledges that combinations of anthropogenic and climatic pressures cannot be excluded when assessing biological impacts, particularly in areas like the Oslofjord where cod population decline may result from multiple stressors including both chemical contamination and climatic factors.

Several methodological gaps are identified that relate to climate change assessment. Many scientific barriers in biology, chemistry and oceanography remain unidentified for distinguishing between biological effects caused by chemical contaminants versus environmental factors. This represents a fundamental gap in separating chemical impacts from climate-related environmental changes.

Coverage and frequency gaps exist in monitoring programs, with minimal sampling sites per region and inadequate statistical approaches for scaling from local to regional assessments. This limits the ability to detect climate-related changes across the broader North-East Atlantic area.

The assessment criteria approach appears rudimentary, particularly when trying to define indicator response thresholds across regions with considerable environmental variation. Age-related confounding effects in fish populations also complicate assessments, as it's unclear whether observed effects result from aging, long-term chronic exposure, or other factors including climate change.

Finally, there's a need for evolution in monitoring approaches to integrate new analytical methodologies and expand to additional species groups to better capture ecosystem-wide responses to combined chemical and climatic stressors.",,"Based on the provided context, there are no specific recommendations relating to climate change, and the document does not address issues requiring further climate-related investigation or research. The context focuses exclusively on chemical contaminants and their biological effects in marine environments.

The document addresses understanding how organisms cope with chemical exposure stress ""in a context of global change"" and notes the need to distinguish biological effects of chemical contaminants from environmental factors, but it does not elaborate on climate-specific aspects or provide climate-related recommendations.

The report focuses extensively on chemical contamination and its biological effects on marine organisms in the OSPAR Maritime Area, covering topics such as biomarkers, chemical contaminants, biological assessment criteria, and case studies of chemical pollution impacts on various marine species.

Ocean acidification is mentioned only once in passing on the final page as part of an organizational vision statement about having a North-East Atlantic Ocean that is ""resilient to climate change and ocean acidification,"" but no scientific findings, data, analysis, or assessment regarding ocean acidification are presented in the document.

The report's substantive content examines chemical pollution through monitoring of contaminants like tributyltin (TBT), polycyclic aromatic compounds, and their effects on sentinel species including cod, mussels, gastropods, and other marine organisms. It details biological effects monitoring using biomarkers, establishes assessment thresholds (BAC and EAC), and presents case studies from locations such as the Oslofjord, Bay of Seine, and Firth of Forth. The document also discusses future monitoring needs for chemical exposome assessment and endocrine disruption.

Instead, the context focuses exclusively on chemical contamination effects in marine environments.

The context documents chemical contamination impacts through studies conducted across the North-East Atlantic from Iceland to Spain using sentinel species including cod, herring, sole, eelpout, whiting, saithe, mussels, flounder, dab, and gastropods. Chemical contamination induces biological effects that impact marine organism health and biodiversity. Some contaminants persist in marine environments for centuries and accumulate in organisms and food chains, leading to direct or indirect effects including combined effects at very low concentrations.

Specific documented impacts include chronic chemical effects on cod metabolic adaptability in the Oslofjord since 2010, contributing to perceived population decline. In the Seine estuary, chemical toxicity manifests as genotoxicity, neurotoxicity, and cytotoxicity in mussels and flatfish. Tributyltin (TBT) causes fertility and calcification impairments in oysters and induces imposex in female gastropod snails, leading to infertility and local population declines. The document establishes that biological effects of long-term chemical exposure appear to be main sources of cod population decline in some areas.

While ocean acidification is mentioned only as part of an aspirational statement about ecosystem resilience, no scientific data, findings, or analysis regarding acidification impacts on marine life are provided in the context. The entire technical content concerns chemical pollutant monitoring, biomarker assessments, and contamination effects rather than acidification-related impacts.",,1,1,2

The documents mention that marine areas need to be ""resilient to climate change and ocean acidification"" as part of environmental objectives, but no substantive findings, data, or analysis about climate change impacts are presented.

The context focuses exclusively on ship emissions and discharges from Exhaust Gas Cleaning Systems (EGCS) in the OSPAR Maritime Area during 2020. Ships in OSPAR regions emitted significant amounts of CO₂, with vessels responsible for 83% of CO₂ emissions being identifiable through MMSI codes. The OSPAR domain accounts for a relatively large share of methane emissions compared to CO₂ when measured against global totals, reflecting increased use of Liquid Natural Gas (LNG) as marine fuel.

However, these emission data are presented in the context of marine pollution from scrubber systems rather than climate change analysis. The reports examine how ships discharge approximately 622 million cubic meters of EGCS effluent containing metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons into OSPAR waters, but do not analyze climate impacts, temperature changes, sea level rise, or other climate-related phenomena.

The documents also reference ocean acidification alongside climate change as an environmental concern requiring resilience, but provide no data, measurements, or analysis of acidification levels, trends, or impacts in the OSPAR Maritime Area.

The document is entirely focused on modeling discharges from Exhaust Gas Cleaning Systems (EGCS) or scrubbers on ships in the OSPAR Maritime Area during 2020.

The only reference to climate change appears in a vision statement about maintaining a marine environment ""resilient to climate change and ocean acidification,"" but this provides no substantive information about climate-related threats or pressures.

The document examines shipping emissions and marine pollution pressures, including CO2 emissions from ships (which contributed about 9% of global shipping CO2 in 2020 within OSPAR regions), and contamination from scrubber discharges containing metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. However, these findings are not presented in the context of climate change impacts or pressures.

The analysis focuses on immediate pollution concerns from scrubber discharges, with over 9.5 billion tonnes of open loop EGCS effluent discharged globally to seas in 2020, and significant contamination hotspots in areas like the English Channel and North Sea. While these shipping activities contribute to both local pollution and global carbon emissions, the document does not discuss climate change as a threat or pressure to the marine environment.",,"The provided context does not address how climate change impacts species, habitats and ecosystems. Instead, the context focuses exclusively on the environmental impacts of Exhaust Gas Cleaning Systems (EGCS) from ships - specifically the discharge of scrubber water containing metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) into OSPAR maritime areas.

The document analyzes contaminant loads from ship scrubbers, showing that total EGCS discharge across all OSPAR regions was approximately 622 million tonnes in 2020. It details metal contamination including vanadium (106 tonnes), zinc (87 tonnes), nickel (35 tonnes), and copper (22 tonnes) as the largest calculated loads. The English Channel is identified as probably the most heavily impacted European sea area regarding EGCS discharge, with about 38% of total discharge occurring in UK waters including the North Sea, Celtic Sea and English Channel.

The context compares scrubber discharge loads to riverine inputs, finding that for Sweden, regulating scrubber discharge could reduce cadmium, copper and mercury loads by 5.2-7.4% compared to riverine input. However, this analysis relates entirely to marine pollution from shipping activities rather than climate change effects on marine ecosystems.

While the context mentions climate change and ocean acidification as challenges requiring resilience, it provides no specific information about temperature changes, sea level rise, ecosystem shifts, species migration patterns, habitat degradation, or other climate-related impacts on marine life that would directly answer the question posed.",,"Based on the provided OSPAR report context, there are limited explicit mentions of gaps in relation to climate change. The context primarily focuses on ship emissions and effluent discharges from exhaust gas cleaning systems (EGCS), with minimal direct discussion of climate change gaps.

The most relevant climate-related gap identified concerns modeling uncertainties and data limitations. The report indicates that the average absolute deviation in predicted fuel consumption for vessels was 20%, which ""covers all sources of uncertainty concerning gaps in vessel technical data, incomplete AIS coverage, uncertainties in modeling specific fuel oil consumption and ambient conditions."" These gaps in vessel technical data affect the accuracy of emissions modeling, which is relevant to climate change since CO2 emissions from shipping are a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions.

The report notes that shipping in the OSPAR domains emitted about nine percent of global shipping CO2 in 2020, with the largest fuel consumption estimated for containerships, oil tankers and dry cargo ships. However, the context reveals gaps in comprehensive climate impact assessment, as the modeling work focuses primarily on pollutant discharges rather than comprehensive climate effects.

Additional gaps include incomplete ship fleet data and significant delays (several months) between EGCS installation, flag state notification and data availability through databases, which affects real-time monitoring capabilities relevant to climate impact assessment.

The context indicates ongoing work through the H2020/EMERGE project (2020-2024) to address some modeling limitations, but specific climate change-related gaps are not comprehensively detailed in the available text. The report appears to focus more on marine pollution from ship discharges rather than broader climate change considerations.",,"Based on the provided context, this OSPAR report focuses specifically on modeling discharges from open circuit flue gas scrubbers on ships rather than climate change recommendations. The context contains limited information directly addressing climate change recommendations or research needs.

The only explicit climate change reference appears in a vision statement mentioning resilience ""to climate change and ocean acidification,"" but this provides no specific recommendations or research priorities.

However, the report does identify several research needs related to marine environmental impacts that may have indirect climate relevance:

The ongoing H2020/EMERGE project (2020-2024) will update modeling tools for environmental impact assessments and include complementary laboratory analysis of effluent composition and dispersion modeling to determine where sea currents carry discharges. Future research should focus on reducing discharge rate uncertainty, particularly regarding fuel sulfur content used by ships equipped with scrubbers and seawater properties used in SOx scrubbing.

The report identifies needs for better understanding of environmental impacts from all available fuel alternatives, improved fuel characterization standards beyond current engine/operational perspectives, and development of water quality guidelines for vanadium. There is also need for more extensive characterization of different low sulfur fuel oil types and inclusion of vanadium, nickel, and chromium in marine monitoring programs.

Most uncertainties stem from EGCS discharge rate determination, connected to fuel sulfur content and seawater properties used in SOx scrubbing processes.

The context is insufficient to provide comprehensive climate change recommendations, as the report's scope is limited to scrubber discharge modeling rather than broader climate change mitigation or adaptation strategies.",,"Based on the provided context, ocean acidification is mentioned only briefly in relation to OSPAR's resilience goals, with no substantive scientific findings, data, or analysis presented about the phenomenon itself.

The context primarily focuses on ship exhaust gas cleaning systems (EGCS) and their acidic discharges to marine waters. Open loop EGCS discharge water is acidic with pH typically below 3, representing a localized acidification impact from shipping operations. In 2020, approximately 622 million cubic meters of EGCS effluent were discharged across all OSPAR regions, with the highest concentrations in the English Channel and North Sea (OSPAR Region II), accounting for nearly half of all discharges despite the limited water area.

The acidic nature of these discharges, combined with metal contaminants including vanadium (106 tonnes), zinc (87 tonnes), and copper (22 tonnes) annually, represents a significant localized source of acidification and contamination. The English Channel is identified as probably the most heavily impacted European sea area regarding EGCS discharge due to the concentrated volume in confined waters.

However, the context provides no information about broader ocean acidification trends, causes, measurements, or impacts in the OSPAR Maritime Area. There is no discussion of pH changes from atmospheric CO2 absorption, carbonate chemistry alterations, or effects on marine ecosystems that typically characterize ocean acidification studies. The document focuses exclusively on modeling ship-based discharges and their immediate chemical impacts rather than examining ocean acidification as a climate-related phenomenon affecting the North-East Atlantic.",,"Based on the provided context, there is insufficient information to answer the question about how ocean acidification impacts species, habitats and ecosystems. 

The context provided consists entirely of technical information about Exhaust Gas Cleaning Systems (EGCS) and scrubber discharges from ships in the OSPAR Maritime Area. The documents analyze shipping discharge patterns, contaminant loads from scrubber systems, and regional distribution of maritime emissions across OSPAR regions I-V during 2020.

The available information focuses on acidic discharge water from open loop scrubbers (typically pH<3), contaminant loads including metals like vanadium (106 tonnes), zinc (87 tonnes), and copper (22 tonnes) in OSPAR regions, and the geographic distribution of 622 million cubic meters of EGCS effluent discharged in 2020. However, this shipping-related acidic discharge represents a localized pollution source rather than the broader ocean acidification phenomenon caused by atmospheric CO2 absorption.

To properly address the question about ocean acidification impacts on species, habitats and ecosystems, different source material containing relevant marine chemistry and biological research would be needed.",,1,1,7
All other assessments,Ocean acidification,OK,p00898_ocean_acidification_qsr2023,"Climate change is intricately linked with ocean acidification throughout the OSPAR analysis, with both stressors acting together to impact marine ecosystems. Earth System Models used in CMIP6 project that doubling atmospheric CO2 would lead to warming between 1.8° to 5.6°C, demonstrating significant uncertainty in climate sensitivity. The models show different responses to greenhouse gas increases due to varying representations of climatic processes, particularly in how aerosols interact with clouds.

Climate change manifests through multiple ocean stressors including warming, increased stratification, circulation changes, deoxygenation, eutrophication, and extreme events like marine heat waves. These changes expose marine life to conditions they have not previously encountered. The carbon system's interaction with climate consequences is complex - climate feedbacks could either mitigate acidification effects (higher salinity increases alkalinity and buffer capacity) or intensify them (reduced ventilation increases remineralization rates and lowers buffer capacity).

Achieving carbon emission reduction targets to limit warming to 1.5-2°C represents the most effective measure to limit ocean acidification. However, measures targeting other greenhouse gases like methane and nitrous oxide, while important for addressing warming, do little to directly limit acidification. Current and continuing CO2 emissions commit oceans to acidified conditions on decadal to century timescales due to slow ocean overturning.

Management interventions may ""buy time"" but rapid climate change and changing ocean conditions may ultimately outstrip the additional tolerance gained through adaptive strategies for vulnerable species and ecosystems. The rate of change and marine organisms' capacity to adapt will determine outcomes. Studies demonstrate that species are more affected by combined ocean acidification and warming than by warming alone.",,"Climate change presents multiple interconnected threats to marine ecosystems that operate cumulatively with ocean acidification. Marine organisms face exposure to climate-related stressors including warming, deoxygenation, and extreme events such as marine heat waves. These climate stressors interact with ocean acidification to create more severe cumulative impacts than any single stressor alone - species were likely more affected by combined ocean acidification and warming than by warming alone.

Ocean acidification itself is accelerating in Arctic regions faster than global levels, and the frequency of compound extreme events, including strong acidification combined with marine heat waves, is likely to increase. The deep Arctic basin is already corrosive to calcareous structures and this area is projected to double by 2100 under high emission scenarios.

Climate change alters ocean conditions through warming, increased stratification, and circulation changes, creating complex interactions with the carbon system. These changes expose marine life to deviations from normal conditions they have not previously encountered. The threat from climate change and ocean acidification is increasing for vulnerable ecosystems like cold-water coral reefs, while other pressures like oil and gas industry threats have decreased.

Threatened and declining species already under pressure are particularly vulnerable to these changing environmental conditions. Even if Paris Agreement goals are achieved, further acidification is inevitable, though the rate depends on emission reduction effectiveness. Management interventions may provide temporary relief, but rapid climate change and changing ocean conditions may ultimately exceed organisms' adaptive capacity, depending on the rate of change and species' ability to adapt to future conditions.",,"Marine ecosystems face unprecedented multiple stresses from climate change, with ocean acidification and warming acting as cumulative stressors that will fundamentally alter species distribution, structure, and ecosystem functioning. Ocean acidification poses a major threat to marine species and ecosystems, with evidence showing most marine organisms will suffer negative impacts including mortality and possible extinction at projected future acidity levels.

Climate change impacts operate through several interconnected mechanisms. Rising temperatures combined with ocean acidification create greater impacts on commercially important shellfish species than pH changes alone. Species' capacity to adapt depends critically on the rate and extent of environmental change, with threatened and declining species being particularly vulnerable as they are already under pressure. Horse mussel beds face potential elimination from the UK marine protected area network by 2100 due to rising sea temperatures and acidification.

Carbonate-dependent organisms experience direct dissolution of calcium carbonate shells and skeletons, affecting structural habitats. Cold-water coral reefs like Lophelia pertusa are under particular threat, along with commercial species including mussels, oysters, lobsters, crabs and cockles. Ocean acidification significantly impacts bivalve larvae survival across populations, largely independent of other factors like food availability.

Biological responses vary spatially and between species, life stages, and populations, with local adaptation influencing tolerance levels. The Arctic basin is already corrosive to calcareous structures, projected to double by 2100 under high emission scenarios. Climate change compounds effects through warming, deoxygenation, eutrophication, and extreme events like marine heatwaves, creating complex multi-stressor environments.

Management interventions may ""buy time,"" but rapid climate change and changing ocean conditions may ultimately outstrip organisms' adaptive capacity, with effectiveness depending on the rate of change and species' inherent resilience capabilities.",,"The context reveals several critical gaps in knowledge and capabilities related to climate change and ocean acidification understanding and response.

**Knowledge and Understanding Gaps:**

Major knowledge gaps exist regarding the drivers of ocean acidification changes, preventing scientists from providing evidence and advice on mitigation and adaptation policies. The lack of understanding of these drivers hampers the ability to develop effective risk assessments, environmental status assessments, and adaptation planning in response to climate change impacts.

Many gaps remain in knowledge about ocean acidification effects on shellfish, with further work clearly needed to fully document the type and magnitude of effects. Better understanding is required of how blue carbon ecosystems will respond to climate change, factors influencing carbon sequestration, and the effects of ecosystem disturbance.

Scientists need improved understanding of species' ability to tolerate and adapt to likely changes, including new climate extremes. The indirect consequences and feedbacks of anthropogenic carbon dioxide removal methods remain unclear, with potentially wide-ranging effects on biogeochemical cycles and climate.

**Data and Monitoring Gaps:**

Sustained funding for long-term time series programs is lacking, hampering the ability to continually collect critical climate change monitoring data. Long-term, high-quality data is essential for evaluating trends, especially in complex coastal regions. Spatial and temporal resolution of existing data is often too coarse to determine trends in ocean acidification over specific areas like OSPAR regions, particularly for surface waters.

**Methodological and Technical Gaps:**

Reconstruction synthesis products and process-based models do not capture near-shore dynamics associated with coastal time series. Regional models with adequate spatial resolution are needed because global Earth System Models lack sufficient resolution and detailed process descriptions. Close dialogue between monitoring and modeling communities is needed to optimize observation use and inform monitoring program expansion.",,"The OSPAR report makes comprehensive recommendations regarding climate change and ocean acidification across three main areas: mitigation, adaptation, and research priorities.

For mitigation, achieving carbon emissions reduction targets to limit warming to 1.5-2°C through switching from fossil fuels to alternative energy sources represents the most effective measure to limit ocean acidification. Ocean-based carbon dioxide removal techniques require careful evaluation of their viability, effectiveness, and environmental risks, particularly whether they alleviate or exacerbate ocean acidification. Climate change mitigation strategies must consider ecosystem resilience and minimize impacts on ecosystem services from a broad climate perspective that accounts for ocean acidification.

Adaptation measures focus on building ecosystem resilience through reducing other anthropogenic pressures like pollution and habitat destruction to enhance tolerance to acidification and climate impacts. Management interventions must consider ocean acidification within a multi-stressor environment, as marine ecosystems face cumulative pressures from changing environmental conditions beyond just acidification. Nature-based solutions have been proposed to reduce acidification exposure, though their efficacy remains undemonstrated.

Critical research gaps requiring investigation include: developing higher frequency measurements in variable coastal sites; conducting studies under realistic rather than extreme conditions; implementing multi-stressor approaches for accurate species response understanding; expanding knowledge of impacts on threatened species and habitats; fostering better understanding of species' evolutionary adaptation capabilities; developing robust bioindicators with wide biogeographical relevance; advancing transdisciplinary studies incorporating socio-economic perspectives; improving dialogue between monitoring and modeling communities; supporting regional model projections through multi-model ensembles; and utilizing down-scaled process-based models for coastal environments. Enhanced monitoring programs must be designed to investigate biological impacts and inform management measures effectively.",,"Ocean acidification constitutes a major threat to marine species, ecosystems, and ecosystem services across all OSPAR regions. The phenomenon results from anthropogenic carbon uptake by the ocean, which alters seawater carbonate chemistry and increases acidity, though warming also contributes to decreasing pH in upper waters.

Observable acidification is occurring throughout the OSPAR Maritime Area, with pH decline rates varying between -0.0011 and -0.033 yr⁻¹. The strongest rates of decline appear in near-shore and coastal regions, where local factors amplify acidification impacts. Two of the longest time series from Icelandic stations show pH declines of -0.0033 and -0.0027 yr⁻¹ over 30+ years. In the Nordic Seas, surface pH decreased by 0.11 between 1981 and 2019, with acidification affecting water masses as deep as 2000 meters.

Future projections indicate acidification will continue across all OSPAR regions throughout the 21st century under mid- and high emission scenarios. The deep Arctic basin is already corrosive to calcareous structures, with this area projected to double by 2100 under high emission scenarios.

Marine organisms face multiple impacts from acidification. Calcifying organisms requiring carbonate ions to build shells and skeletons are particularly vulnerable, especially when aragonite saturation state drops below 1, creating corrosive conditions for calcium carbonate structures. Cold-water coral reefs like Lophelia and commercial species including mussels, oysters, lobsters, crabs, and cockles face particular threats. Early life stages, larvae, and juveniles show greater sensitivity than adults.

However, responses vary significantly among species. While many organisms suffer negative impacts, others may benefit. Seagrasses and epiphytes can thrive under acidification, while crustaceans show less sensitivity compared to other groups. Meta-analyses reveal that acidification effects differ across life stages and interact with other environmental stressors including temperature, oxygen concentration, and pollutants, creating complex multi-stressor scenarios.

The biological impacts vary spatially, with local environmental variability determining what constitutes stressful conditions for different organisms. Species' capacity to adapt depends on the rate of environmental change and evolutionary processes over multiple generations.",,"Ocean acidification significantly impacts marine species, habitats, and ecosystems through multiple pathways and mechanisms. Experimental studies demonstrate that calcium carbonate-dependent organisms face particular vulnerability as acidification increases dissolution risk for carbonate shells and skeletons that structure benthic habitats.

Most marine taxa experience negative impacts from projected acidification levels, though responses vary considerably between species and regions. Early larval and juvenile stages show greatest sensitivity, with bivalve larvae facing impaired growth, survival, and calcification. Atlantic cod embryos experience constrained thermal performance windows, while commercial shellfish species suffer significant negative effects when acidification combines with temperature increases under laboratory conditions.

When organisms cannot maintain pH homeostasis or replace dissolved calcified structures, they experience reduced fitness and mortality. Energy costs increase for calcifying organisms to build and maintain their calcium carbonate structures. Cold-water coral reefs, particularly Lophelia pertusa, face severe threats as many will be exposed to waters corrosive to aragonite structures by century's end, with decreased calcification and increased dissolution even at aragonite-saturated conditions.

Biological impacts vary spatially across regions and habitats due to different baseline conditions and natural variability. Ecosystems structured around complex ecological interactions may amplify or lessen acidification effects. The multi-decadal nature of acidification allows potential acclimation and evolution, though adaptive capacity depends on the rate and extent of environmental change.

Acidification interacts cumulatively with other stressors including warming, oxygen changes, and pollution, intensifying overall ecosystem stress. Commercial species face long-term negative consequences, particularly molluscs, with significant projected economic losses. Threatened and declining species show heightened vulnerability to these changing conditions.",,88,409,563

Multiple references identify threats from habitat alteration or loss, obstacles to migration, and pollution as key concerns for various species. Several monitoring efforts track ""key pressures including loss and change of substratum, levels of eutrophication"" for different habitats.

For specific species groups, the analysis reveals various non-climate pressures: marine protected areas are being used to reduce activities and pressures affecting fish species with vulnerable populations; threats to marine turtles include habitat degradation requiring conservation strategies; and deep-sea habitats face implementation challenges due to technical and financial difficulties in monitoring threats and pressures.

The reports indicate that some habitats have low implementation levels ""primarily due to severe knowledge gaps concerning the occurrence and extent of these habitats, as well as status and most relevant threats/pressures."" However, these knowledge gaps are not specifically identified as climate-related.

The context emphasizes that OSPAR Recommendations aim to ""reduce the main threats from human activities and pressures,"" but climate change is not explicitly detailed among these documented threats.

Reported threats include habitat alteration and loss, obstacles to migration routes, removal of species, introduction of non-native species, eutrophication, loss and change of substratum, and impacts from fishing activities.

The context demonstrates that species experience different pressures at various stages of their life cycles, particularly for migratory species like birds that have distinct breeding and non-breeding areas. Deep-sea habitats face specific challenges from technical and financial monitoring difficulties, while coastal habitats interact more extensively with human activities.

There has been little or no research on the ecological significance of seamounts or status of these vulnerable ecosystems.

**Monitoring Gaps**: Habitat quality is not as widely monitored compared to other parameters and needs to be addressed. Monitoring deep-sea features like hydrothermal vents and seamounts requires expensive and complex surveys, restricting feasibility. Several Contracting Parties struggled with technical and financial challenges in monitoring features and their threats and pressures.

**Implementation Gaps**: Gap-analysis revealed low implementation levels for some habitats, primarily due to severe knowledge gaps and additional uncertainties concerning delineation and definition. Data and information gaps stood out as the primary barrier for implementing measures for marine turtle species.

**Coordination Gaps**: Improving regional collaboration and coordination on monitoring efforts was highlighted as crucial for overcoming implementation difficulties. Features are affected by human activities regulated by non-OSPAR states, requiring broader international cooperation beyond EU-level coordination.

**Technical and Capacity Gaps**: Technical difficulties prevent measure implementation, with cost-effectiveness concerns and lack of systematic mapping limiting progress. The expensive nature of deep-sea research activities restricts the ability to improve knowledge bases for these critical ecosystems.",,"The provided context does not contain specific recommendations regarding climate change mitigation or adaptation measures. While climate change is mentioned in OSPAR's vision for a North-East Atlantic Ocean that is ""resilient to climate change and ocean acidification,"" the context primarily focuses on implementation of species and habitat conservation recommendations rather than climate-specific actions.

The context reveals several research and investigation needs, though not explicitly climate-related: sophisticated modelling approaches requiring input from modelling experts to identify critical habitats and key areas, with expert consultations planned for 2020. Literature and data reviews have been completed as preparatory work. Research gaps include studies on source populations and status assessments, monitoring and assessment programmes for various species, and understanding distribution patterns of deep-sea habitats.

These impacts may damage critical tourism infrastructure, particularly as melting permafrost and coastal erosion threaten basic facility foundations in Arctic regions.

The warming climate has created ""last chance tourism"" in Arctic waters, where tourists visit areas ""before they're lost"" due to environmental changes. Polar bears face threats from steadily decreasing sea ice, becoming iconic symbols of climate impacts. Decreased ice coverage enables increased shipping activities through the Northern Sea Route instead of conventional routes via the Suez Canal.

Climate change may increase invasions of non-native species in Arctic regions through expanded human development activities. The tourism industry requires greater engagement in energy and water management to adapt to changing water availability and sustain long-term operations. Belgium has identified climate change as one of five main drivers influencing tourism development.

Cross-cutting policy approaches integrate climate change mitigation and adaptation with environmental protection, regional development and sustainable transport for coastal and maritime tourism. OSPAR's 2030 strategy focuses on achieving seas resilient to climate change and ocean acidification impacts. However, coastal erosion poses significant ongoing threats to tourism services, requiring coastal managers to balance economic, social and environmental considerations while implementing technical solutions like beach nourishment to mitigate storm risks and maintain recreational benefits.",,"Climate change poses multiple threats to marine tourism and coastal environments across the OSPAR Maritime Area. Sea level rise, beach erosion, precipitation changes, and weather instability threaten tourism sector performance, with coastal regions being especially vulnerable and northern coastal areas less so.

In the Arctic region, melting permafrost and coastal erosion may damage essential infrastructure needed for tourism development. The steady decrease of sea ice threatens polar bears, creating ""last chance tourism"" where operators market Arctic experiences to visitors wanting to see landscapes before climate change alters them permanently. This warming climate has transformed traditional tourism products, with tourists representing the largest visitor group alongside researchers.

Increased shipping activities are expected as ice decrease makes the Northern Sea Route accessible, replacing conventional routes through the Suez Canal. Climate change may increase non-native species invasion in the Arctic through expanded human development.

The tourism industry faces water availability challenges requiring better energy and water management adaptation. Eutrophication problems affect large surface areas, with the Greater North Sea showing the most extensive problem areas in 2017, and significant issues identified from Belgium to Denmark and in Danish-Swedish waters.

Physical infrastructure faces direct threats from coastal erosion, creating technical and management challenges for coastal managers balancing economic, social, and environmental aspects. Beach tourism destinations are particularly dependent on stable climate conditions but face increasing pressure from rising sea levels and storm damage.

OSPAR's 2021 NEAES strategy specifically focuses on developing seas resilient to climate change impacts and ocean acidification, recognizing these as fundamental challenges requiring regional cooperation and adaptive management strategies.",,"Climate change significantly impacts species, habitats and ecosystems in the Northeast Atlantic through multiple pathways. The disappearance of summer Arctic sea ice leads to increased invasion of non-native species in the Arctic through expanded human developments. Polar bears face direct threats from the steady decrease of sea ice, making them an iconic symbol of climate change impacts.

Climate change alters unique Arctic landscapes so substantially that tourism operators market ""last chance tourism"" for visitors wanting to experience these areas before they are irreversibly changed. The warming climate enables new shipping routes as ice coverage decreases, fundamentally changing ecosystem accessibility and exposure to human pressures.

Physical infrastructure damage occurs through melting permafrost and coastal erosion, while sea water level increases, beach erosion, precipitation changes and weather instability directly affect coastal ecosystems. Extreme weather conditions impact hydrography through altered water exchange patterns and tidal systems, affecting the rich biological systems containing diverse fish, birds, and marine mammal species.

The Greater North Sea's complex biological systems face particular vulnerability due to these hydrographic changes. Climate change compounds other ecosystem stressors, as biofouling species outgrow and out-compete native species while disturbing spawning patterns of species like Atlantic herring. Non-indigenous species introductions increase, causing genetic changes in native populations and spreading diseases and pathogens with global-scale environmental impacts.

Coastal ecosystems experience heightened stress levels and reduced biodiversity under combined climate and human pressures. Marine ecosystems face physical damage through increased sediment resuspension and erosion affecting fauna and flora. The interconnected nature of these climate impacts creates cascading effects throughout marine food webs and habitat structures.",,"The OSPAR reports identify several significant gaps in relation to climate change impacts on marine environments and tourism sectors.

Infrastructure vulnerability represents a major gap, as climate change impacts like melting permafrost and coastal erosion damage essential tourism infrastructure. The tourism industry faces particular challenges from sea water level increases, beach erosion, precipitation changes and weather instability, with coastal regions being especially vulnerable while northern coastal regions show less vulnerability.

Policy integration gaps are evident, as the European Commission recognizes the need to consider ""cross-cutting policy aspects such as environmental protection, regional development, training, consumer protection and climate change mitigation and adaptation policies"" when addressing coastal and maritime tourism. However, implementation remains incomplete.

Management and funding gaps persist in achieving climate resilience objectives. Despite OSPAR's 2021 NEAES 2030 strategy focusing on seas resilient to climate change and ocean acidification impacts, Member States have not reached Good Environmental Status by 2020 targets. This failure stems from ""the complexity of analysing and managing the marine environment and reporting on it, the lack of political will to adequately fund and enforce the necessary measures, or the lack of involvement of other economic and private sectors.""

Adaptation gaps exist within the tourism industry itself. While the tourism industry could engage more in energy and water management to adapt to changing water availability and climate change, current efforts remain insufficient to sustain the industry's future.

Regional assessment gaps are apparent, as climate change may lead to increased invasion of non-native species in the Arctic through expanded human developments, yet comprehensive monitoring and response strategies appear underdeveloped for these emerging threats.",,"Based on the provided context, OSPAR identifies seas resilient to climate change and ocean acidification as a key focus area in their NEAES 2030 strategy. Climate change presents significant challenges for the tourism and recreation sector in the OSPAR Maritime Area, with sea level rise, beach erosion, precipitation changes, and weather instability potentially affecting sector performance. Coastal regions are especially vulnerable, though northern coastal regions face lower vulnerability levels.

The context identifies several specific climate change impacts requiring attention: melting permafrost and coastal erosion may damage tourism infrastructure in Arctic regions, affecting economic development sustainability. Arctic tourism increasingly markets itself as ""last chance tourism"" due to warming climate threatening iconic species like polar bears through decreasing sea ice. Increased shipping activities through Arctic routes like the Northern Sea Route may create interference with recreational activities, though this requires further investigation.

The tourism industry requires enhanced engagement in energy and water management to adapt to changing water availability and climate change impacts. Fresh water scarcity poses real challenges in certain OSPAR Maritime Area regions, particularly as tourism's indirect water requirements for food production, building materials, and energy remain insufficiently understood but are expected to exceed direct water use substantially.

European policy frameworks emphasize integrating climate change mitigation and adaptation policies as cross-cutting aspects alongside environmental protection in coastal and maritime tourism planning. Marine spatial planning should apply ecosystem approaches to ensure sustainable marine resource use while protecting the environment.

The context indicates that understanding of tourism's indirect climate impacts requires further research, particularly regarding comprehensive water requirements. Additionally, the potential interference between increased Arctic shipping and recreational activities due to reduced ice cover needs investigation to inform future management decisions.",,"Ocean acidification is specifically mentioned in the OSPAR reports as one of the key challenges that marine environments need to be resilient against. In 2021, OSPAR agreed to its North-East Atlantic Environment Strategy 2030 (NEAES 2030), which focuses on four main themes, including ""seas resilient to the impacts of climate change and ocean acidification.""

Beyond this strategic recognition, the provided context contains limited specific information about ocean acidification itself. The reports do not provide detailed analysis, data, or findings about acidification levels, trends, impacts, or specific measures to address ocean acidification in the OSPAR Maritime Area.

The context primarily focuses on other marine environmental issues such as marine litter, eutrophication, hazardous substances, underwater noise, and various pressures from tourism and recreation activities. While climate change impacts are mentioned in relation to sea level rise, beach erosion, and weather instability affecting coastal regions, ocean acidification is not elaborated upon as a distinct issue requiring specific assessment or action.

The Marine Strategy Framework Directive, which OSPAR works within, identifies various pressures affecting marine ecosystems including non-indigenous species, fishing, human-induced eutrophication, habitat alteration, contaminants, marine litter, and underwater noise, but ocean acidification is not explicitly listed among these main pressures in the available context.

This indicates that while OSPAR recognizes ocean acidification as an important future challenge requiring marine ecosystem resilience, the provided context does not contain substantive analysis or specific measures addressing this issue.",,"The provided context does not contain specific information about how ocean acidification impacts species, habitats and ecosystems. While ocean acidification is mentioned once as a climate change impact that seas need to be resilient to in OSPAR's NEAES 2030 strategy, no detailed findings, data, or analysis about its ecological effects are presented.

The context primarily focuses on recreational and tourism activities in the North-East Atlantic Ocean and their environmental impacts. The extensive documentation covers impacts from recreational fishing, boating, beach tourism, and cruise activities, including effects from non-indigenous species introductions, marine litter, underwater noise, eutrophication, and physical disturbances to marine fauna and flora. Specific impacts described include decreased native species populations, genetic changes, habitat degradation, reduced benthic invertebrate diversity, and threats to seagrass habitats and cetaceans.

The context also addresses marine protection measures, with OSPAR's Marine Protected Areas network comprising 496 MPAs covering 864,337 km² aimed at protecting and restoring species, habitats and ecological processes. Various pressures affecting marine ecosystems are identified under the Marine Strategy Framework Directive, including non-indigenous species, fishing, human-induced eutrophication, and permanent habitat alteration.

However, the scientific findings presented relate exclusively to tourism and recreation impacts rather than ocean acidification effects. To comprehensively answer the question about ocean acidification impacts on marine life, additional context containing relevant scientific data and analysis would be required.",,11,1,14
All other assessments,Reports and assessments of the status of OSPAR network of MPAs in 2021,OK,p00876_mpa_status_report_assessment_2021_vers002,"Based on the provided context, climate change is mentioned only briefly and in limited ways within this OSPAR marine protected areas report. The context identifies climate change as part of a ""triple challenge"" facing the ocean, alongside biodiversity loss and pollution including marine litter. The North-East Atlantic Environment Strategy (NEAES) 2030 sets collective objectives to address this triple challenge, with climate change implementation being part of OSPAR's contribution to achieving the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

The only other reference appears in OSPAR's organizational vision statement, which mentions building resilience to ""climate change and ocean acidification"" in the North-East Atlantic Ocean, though this statement was excluded per the instructions to focus on substantive findings rather than organizational visions.

The context is insufficient to provide details about specific climate change impacts, effects on marine protected areas, adaptation measures, or any climate-related scientific findings or data. The document appears to be primarily focused on assessing the status, management, and ecological coherence of the OSPAR marine protected area network, with climate change mentioned only as background context for the broader environmental challenges facing the marine environment. No specific climate change research, monitoring data, projections, or climate-related conservation strategies are presented in the available passages.",,"Based on the provided context, threats or pressures related to climate change are identified as one of three major challenges facing the ocean, alongside biodiversity loss and pollution (including marine waste). The North-East Atlantic Strategy (NEAES) 2030 specifically defines collective objectives to address this ""triple challenge"" confronting the ocean environment.

Climate change represents a fundamental pressure that OSPAR is working to address through resilience-building measures. The strategy emphasizes developing marine protected area networks that are ""resilient to climate change and ocean acidification,"" indicating these are recognized as ongoing and future threats to marine ecosystems.

The assessment reveals that management actions are being developed to address ""known threats and pressures"" to protected features within OSPAR MPAs, though the specific climate-related pressures are not detailed in the available context. Site managers are working to identify management actions required to address various pressures affecting protected species and habitats, with 28% of MPAs having management responses in development to address such threats.

The context indicates that monitoring programs are being established to evaluate ecosystem responses to pressures, though resource constraints are cited as significant barriers to implementing comprehensive ecological monitoring programs. These monitoring efforts are essential for assessing whether conservation measures are effectively addressing climate-related and other environmental pressures.

However, the available context does not provide specific details about the nature of climate change impacts, projected changes in temperature or ocean chemistry, or particular climate-related pressures affecting different species and habitats. The focus remains primarily on developing adaptive management frameworks and resilient conservation networks rather than detailed climate impact assessments.",,"The provided context does not contain information about how climate change impacts species, habitats and ecosystems. The context consists entirely of excerpts from OSPAR reports focused on Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), their ecological assessment, management effectiveness, and the protection of threatened and/or declining species and habitats within the OSPAR network.

The context addresses topics such as MPA ecological coherence assessment using Madrid Criteria, the representation and replication of threatened species and habitats within MPAs, connectivity and resilience of the MPA network, monitoring programs for protected features, and challenges in implementing ecological assessments due to data deficiencies. It details that 28 of 58 OSPAR threatened and/or declining habitats and species are protected within multiple MPAs, discusses barriers to ecological monitoring due to resource constraints, and identifies knowledge gaps regarding the current ecological status of marine ecosystems.

While climate change is mentioned as one of the three major ocean challenges (alongside biodiversity loss and pollution including marine debris), no specific impacts of climate change on marine species, habitats or ecosystems are described in the provided text. The context focuses exclusively on MPA management and assessment methodologies rather than climate change effects on marine biodiversity.",,"The OSPAR report identifies several significant knowledge and data gaps that limit effective marine protection and management. Key gaps include insufficient long-term ecological monitoring programmes across multiple areas. Cost-benefit analyses cannot be performed due to missing long-term ecological monitoring programmes, and there is poor understanding of the exact links between biodiversity and ecosystem benefits.

Monitoring gaps are substantial: 16% of OSPAR MPAs lack any monitoring, unchanged since 2016. Resource constraints represent a significant barrier to implementing regular ecological monitoring programmes. Many sites have baseline surveys but lack ongoing monitoring of protected feature ecological status. The OSPAR MPA database is deficient in information regarding EUNIS Level 3 habitat type protection and gaps exist regarding protection of OSPAR threatened/declining features.

Geographical coverage gaps persist, with considerable gaps in OSPAR Region I (Arctic Waters) and moderate gaps in Region V (Wider Atlantic). Twenty percent of responses indicated uncertainty about whether MPAs are achieving conservation objectives, primarily due to unavailable long-term ecological status information.

Data quality issues affect assessments, as all geographically explicit ecological data is considered deficient with accuracy problems regarding spatial resolution and data collection methods. Consensus is needed on acceptable accuracy levels and recognized websites for ecological distribution data.

Other Effective area-based Conservation Measures (OECMs) present knowledge gaps - most were established long-term but monitoring to ensure positive biodiversity conservation outcomes is mostly missing. The understanding of pristine area conditions is lacking, impeding current area quality evaluation. Six percent of responses regarding mitigation measures were unknown because sites had not yet undergone assessments.",,"Based on the OSPAR report, climate change is identified as one of the triple challenges facing the ocean (alongside biodiversity loss and pollution), but the specific recommendations related to climate change are limited in scope.

The primary climate-related recommendations center on building resilience within the Marine Protected Area (MPA) network. MPAs should be designated with proportions of features that may be higher for particularly threatened and/or declining features that require enhanced protection against threats, including climate impacts. The network design should incorporate connectivity considerations to allow species and habitats to adapt to changing conditions, with MPAs distributed geographically to approximate connectivity in the absence of dispersal data.

For future network development, work should focus on considering nominations of further MPAs in Regions I (Arctic Waters) and V (Wider Atlantic), and in more northerly Dinter biogeographic provinces - areas likely experiencing significant climate-driven changes. The assessment methodology needs improvement to better incorporate ecological distribution data to assess MPA connectivity and network representativity for threatened and declining features.

Several critical research gaps require investigation: the exact links between biodiversity and ecosystem benefits remain poorly understood; long-term ecological monitoring programs are largely missing, preventing cost-benefit analyses; understanding of pristine baseline conditions is lacking, impeding valuation of current ecological status; and geographically explicit ecological data remains deficient regarding spatial resolution and temporal correlation. 

Resource constraints are consistently cited as significant barriers to implementing regular ecological monitoring programs essential for understanding climate impacts. The high complexity of marine ecosystems combined with knowledge gaps on current ecological status creates considerable uncertainties in quantifying benefits and assessing climate resilience of the MPA network.",,"Based on the provided context, ocean acidification receives very limited discussion in this OSPAR report on Marine Protected Areas. The only substantive references to ocean acidification appear in two identical statements indicating that the North-East Atlantic Ocean should be ""resilient to climate change and ocean acidification.""

The context provided is entirely focused on the status, management, and ecological coherence assessment of the OSPAR network of Marine Protected Areas as of 2021. The report extensively covers MPA distribution across OSPAR regions, ecological coherence criteria, management effectiveness, conservation objectives, and monitoring programs. It discusses threats and pressures to protected marine features, but does not specifically identify or analyze ocean acidification as one of these pressures.

The document examines various aspects of marine conservation including biodiversity protection, habitat representation, species conservation, and ecosystem management measures, but does not provide any data, analysis, or specific findings regarding ocean acidification impacts, monitoring, or mitigation strategies within the OSPAR Maritime Area.

This appears to be a specialized report focused specifically on Marine Protected Areas rather than a comprehensive assessment of marine environmental conditions. Therefore, while ocean acidification is acknowledged as a challenge requiring resilience, the provided context contains insufficient information to answer questions about OSPAR's specific findings, data, or recommendations regarding ocean acidification.",,"The provided context does not address ocean acidification impacts on species, habitats and ecosystems. While ocean acidification is mentioned twice as an environmental challenge that the North-East Atlantic Ocean faces alongside climate change, and as something the ocean should be resilient to, the context contains no substantive scientific findings, data, or analysis about how ocean acidification specifically affects marine life.

The context focuses entirely on Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) within the OSPAR Maritime Area, covering topics such as MPA network ecological coherence, protection of threatened and declining species and habitats, management effectiveness, and biodiversity conservation measures. The extensive technical content discusses 28 of 58 OSPAR threatened and/or declining habitats and species being protected within multiple MPAs, monitoring challenges due to resource constraints, and the need for further MPA designation in northern biogeographic provinces, but none of this relates to ocean acidification impacts.

All other assessments,State of the arctic marine biodiversity report_sambr,OK,sambr_scientific_report_2017_final,"Sea ice declines across the circumpolar Arctic represent the most visible and dramatic impact of climate change, with transformative effects on ice-associated Arctic marine mammals through direct habitat loss and indirect ecosystem changes. Arctic marine environments are undergoing rapid warming trends following global ocean temperature increases over the past 30 years, with Barents Sea temperatures rising since the 1970s and seawater temperature increases of up to 4°C expected in the Atlantic sector of the Arctic Ocean.

Climate change is driving multiple interconnected effects across Arctic marine ecosystems. Warming temperatures and altered stratification are changing habitat use patterns, allowing northward expansion of boreal species while stressing Arctic endemic species. Sea ice biota are particularly susceptible due to temperature and salinity effects, nutrient limitations, and the ephemeral nature of ice habitats. Changes in ice conditions affect seabird diets and reveal species plasticity, with some planktivorous seabirds increasing while others experience reduced breeding success from traveling farther for less nutritious food sources.

Marine mammals face extreme habitat changes, with ringed seals altering foraging behavior due to changing ice conditions and polar bears experiencing distributional changes and modified hunting patterns. Fish communities are responding to elevated ocean temperatures through distributional shifts, with polar cod declining in the Barents Sea from 2004-2015 while temperate species move northward. Primary productivity patterns are shifting, with increasing temperatures favoring flagellates over diatoms, potentially affecting higher trophic levels.

Climate change interacts with other stressors including shipping, resource extraction, and pollution, creating cumulative effects. Indigenous communities report changes in ocean currents, stronger storms, and altered benthic species distribution and availability, validating scientific observations of ecosystem-wide transformations.",,"Climate change poses extensive threats and pressures to Arctic marine ecosystems through multiple interconnected pathways. Sea ice decline represents the most visible and dramatic climate impact, fundamentally altering habitat for ice-dependent species and enabling transformative ecosystem changes.

Temperature increases affect species at multiple scales. Ocean temperatures have risen across the Arctic, with up to 4°C warming expected in the Atlantic sector. This warming exceeds temperature limits of some Arctic species while enabling northward expansion of boreal species that create novel predatory and competitive pressures on endemic Arctic populations. Polar cod faces increased predation from Atlantic cod expanding northward, while Arctic copepods experience population declines affecting species dependent on them.

Physical habitat changes extend beyond ice loss to altered ocean currents, increased storm frequency, coastal erosion, and changed sediment dynamics. These modifications affect benthic communities, alter prey distribution patterns, and reduce foraging efficiency for marine mammals like walruses. Sea ice changes force longer migration distances for seals and affect breeding success.

Ecosystem-level disruptions include shifts in plankton communities, changes in primary productivity, and potential harmful algal blooms. Food web alterations cascade upward as southern species move north, sometimes providing less nutritious food sources for Arctic predators. Seabirds show reduced breeding success due to prey shifts, while marine mammals face changing prey availability.

Climate pressures interact synergistically with increasing anthropogenic activities like shipping, resource development, and pollution. These cumulative effects create complex stressor interactions that may lead to sudden ecosystem shifts or ""tipping points."" The analysis emphasizes that most Arctic marine biodiversity changes link directly or indirectly to climate change, creating unprecedented conservation challenges for endemic species already stressed by historical exploitation.",,"Climate change impacts Arctic marine species, habitats, and ecosystems through multiple interconnected pathways, with sea ice decline being the most visible and dramatic effect. Elevated ocean temperatures, altered stratification, wave action, and reduced ice habitat availability are driving fundamental changes in habitat use patterns, enabling northward expansion of bordering species and altering competitive and predator-prey interactions.

Sea ice-dependent species face extreme habitat loss. The ecologically important polar cod declined in the Barents Sea from 2004 to 2015, while sympagic species using sea ice as critical habitat experience direct range contractions. Early spring sea ice retreat reduces suitable breeding and pup-rearing habitat for ringed seals, and polar bear hunting grounds are diminishing as ice platforms for accessing seals disappear.

Marine mammals show varied responses including changes in behavior, abundance, growth rates, body condition, and reproduction. Physical environmental changes alter forage bases through shifts in prey species density and distribution, potentially causing loss of fat-rich prey species. Some seabird species have adapted feeding behaviors due to food supply shifts, traveling farther or foraging on less nutritious species, resulting in lower breeding success for species like black guillemots.

Benthic communities experience pan-Arctic impacts from warming, ice decline, and acidification. Temperature increases exceed limits of stenothermal Arctic species while opening regions to boreal species requiring warmer conditions. Increasing numbers of species are moving into Arctic waters, outcompeting native species or offering less nutritious value as prey.

The timing and duration of sea ice retreat determine when and where species can accomplish vital survival activities. Multi-year ice disappearance causes shifts in ice algal communities with cascading ecosystem effects, while enhanced secondary productivity occurs in some regions with longer ice-free periods.",,"The OSPAR reports identify several critical gaps in climate change knowledge and monitoring within Arctic marine ecosystems. Data insufficiency represents the most fundamental challenge - available data are insufficient to reliably calculate long-term trends for the vast majority of the Arctic marine environment, making it difficult to infer change from sporadic samplings.

Cumulative effects pose a major knowledge gap, particularly regarding how changes in Arctic ecosystems impact marine mammals under increasing pressure from shipping, resource development, and climate change. No standardized method currently exists for determining cumulative effects impacts. The remote nature of Arctic systems creates additional knowledge gaps that could be partially addressed through community-engaged monitoring efforts.

Taxonomic and distributional gaps are extensive. Large Arctic areas have never been surveyed for marine fish biodiversity, with fundamental knowledge gaps existing in taxonomic status and species distributions. Seabed mapping remains limited in Arctic waters. Missing functional groups representing important trophic links and ecosystem functions are covered poorly or not at all, primarily due to logistical challenges and lack of expertise.

Monitoring programs require expansion to include important taxonomic groups and key ecosystem functions. Long-term, internationally comparable monitoring is urgently needed to assess large-scale dynamics in benthic communities and effects of anthropogenic activities in changing environments. The limited time series suggest trends, but uncertainty remains whether zooplankton species are following or leading climate-mediated trends detected in fish and mammal distributions.

Integration challenges persist in connecting existing Arctic biodiversity monitoring programs, with much work remaining to achieve effective ecosystem-based monitoring approaches.",,"OSPAR reports recommend monitoring relevant physical parameters alongside climate-sensitive focal ecosystem components, including sea ice biota and plankton. Ongoing monitoring and collection of new baseline data are essential for reporting on patterns in polar cod and capelin distributions and abundances as key indicators of climate variability and impacts in Arctic marine ecosystems.

Key monitoring recommendations include establishing long-term standardized monitoring of megabenthic communities across all Arctic regions, developing consistent methodology for ice biota monitoring with standardized protocols, and implementing effective marine mammal population monitoring using improved techniques to measure trends relative to climate changes and human activities. Monitoring should occur at sites proximate to marine activity hotspots and include plankton monitoring.

Critical knowledge gaps requiring further investigation include understanding cumulative and synergistic effects of multiple stressors associated with environmental change as temperate species move northward, which may significantly challenge ice-dependent marine mammals. Research needs encompass studying ocean acidification impacts on Arctic species across entire life cycles and the entire Arctic region. Multi-disciplinary research and management efforts are required to improve data on prey species and climate warming impacts.

The reports emphasize developing time- and cost-effective, long-term standardized monitoring frameworks with internationally comparable protocols. Surveys are needed in previously unassessed Arctic areas to provide baseline data, and areas surveyed in the past require revisiting to identify biodiversity changes. Enhanced data collection on species and environmental conditions is necessary to detect causal relationships for observed changes.

Communication of monitoring results between scientists and the public is crucial for developing effective management strategies. The recommendations stress proactive biodiversity monitoring to anticipate future knowledge needs and support informed conservation and adaptation responses to Arctic biodiversity changes.",,"Ocean acidification emerges as a significant threat to Arctic marine ecosystems, driven by increasing atmospheric CO₂ absorption by seawater. Arctic oceans are particularly vulnerable to acidification because CO₂ dissolves more easily in colder water, creating heightened risks for the region's marine life.

The phenomenon fundamentally alters seawater's chemical carbonate balance, directly affecting calcifying organisms. Pelagic snails (pteropods), important zooplankton components, show extreme vulnerability to shell dissolution at near-current pH levels through experimental studies. Arctic copepods like Calanus glacialis demonstrate less sensitivity to elevated pCO₂ levels across life stages, though lowered pH increases metabolic costs at the expense of growth performance.

Calcifying organisms face differential impacts based on shell composition. Organisms using aragonite (more pH-soluble) suffer greater effects than those using calcite. Coccolithophores may adapt to increasing acidity but require additional energy for skeleton construction. Arctic benthic calcifiers, including molluscs, echinoderms and crabs, experience negative effects from increased pCO₂, with decreased calcification, elevated respiration and mortality, and reduced recruitment.

Fish populations also show vulnerability - Atlantic cod exhibits higher juvenile mortality under elevated acidification conditions, though effects on Arctic fishes remain unclear. Arctic benthic species face impacts across adult benthic, pelagic larval, and juvenile stages, with juveniles showing highest sensitivity.

Despite acidification monitoring in some Arctic regions, biological effects monitoring is absent, leaving limited specific evidence for comprehensive ecosystem impact assessment. Few studies examine full life-cycle effects across the entire Arctic, though existing research indicates likely significant ecosystem consequences as acidification intensifies with climate change.",,"Ocean acidification significantly impacts Arctic marine species across multiple trophic levels through direct physiological effects and cascading ecosystem changes. Arctic oceans are particularly vulnerable to acidification because CO2 dissolves more readily in colder water, altering the chemical carbonate balance that affects living conditions for marine biota.

Calcareous organisms face the most direct impacts. Non-Arctic calcareous species demonstrate reduced shell-building capacity along with metabolic and behavioral effects from acidification. Organisms using aragonite, the more soluble form of calcium carbonate, show highest sensitivity. Pelagic snails (pteropods), important zooplankton components, are highly vulnerable to shell dissolution under experimental acidification conditions. Arctic benthic species experience impacts during both adult benthic and pelagic larval stages, with juvenile stages typically most sensitive to acidification effects.

The impacts extend through marine food webs via multiple pathways. Ocean acidification represents a major driver of observed and expected changes in benthic ecosystems across Arctic regions. For Arctic primary producers, increased CO2 levels affect productivity patterns, potentially leading to reduced benthic-pelagic coupling that may diminish food supply for species including shrimp and walrus.

Fish communities also experience acidification effects, though impacts remain unclear for most Arctic species. Recent studies on Atlantic cod showed elevated juvenile mortality under increased acidification conditions, suggesting similar vulnerabilities may exist for other Arctic fish species.

Currently, while acidification monitoring occurs in some Arctic regions, no systematic monitoring of biological effects exists, creating significant knowledge gaps about the full ecosystem-scale impacts of this driver on Arctic biodiversity.",,93,23,180
All other assessments,Status and trends hazardous substances using CHASE,OK,p00912_chase_qsr2023,"The provided context contains virtually no information about climate change. The document focuses entirely on the CHASE (Combined Hazardous Substances Assessment) tool for evaluating hazardous substance contamination in North-East Atlantic marine sediments and biota.

The only reference to climate change appears in a single organizational statement about creating an ocean that is ""resilient to climate change and ocean acidification,"" but this provides no scientific findings, data, or analysis about climate change impacts, trends, or effects.

The document extensively details hazardous substance assessments across OSPAR regions, showing that most areas fail to achieve good environmental status due to contamination from mercury, lead, PAHs, and other pollutants. It presents trend analyses indicating some regions like the Irish Sea, Northern North Sea, and Southern North Sea show significant downward contamination trends in sediments, while biota shows mixed trends with decreasing contamination in the Irish Sea and Iberian Sea but increasing trends in the Southern North Sea and Channel regions.

However, none of this hazardous substance assessment work addresses climate change impacts, climate-related environmental changes, temperature trends, sea level rise, ocean warming, or any other climate change indicators or effects. The document is strictly focused on chemical contamination assessment methodology and regional contamination status trends, making it unsuitable for answering questions about climate change findings or analysis.",,"The provided context does not contain specific information about threats or pressures related to climate change. The document focuses exclusively on chemical contamination assessment using the CHASE methodology, examining contaminants such as mercury, PAH, PCB, cadmium, lead, and PBDE in sediments and biota across OSPAR maritime regions.

The only reference to climate change appears in organizational vision statements mentioning resilience to ""climate change and ocean acidification,"" but no substantive analysis of climate-related threats or pressures is provided in the technical content.

The document presents detailed findings on chemical contamination status across various subregions. Almost the entire OSPAR region II-IV is far from good environmental status based on contamination scores above 1. Only three of 12 biota areas achieve good status, with mercury and CB118 contamination being decisive factors in most subregions. Time trends show mixed patterns: significantly decreasing contamination trends occur in the Irish Sea, Iberian Sea, and Celtic Sea for biota, while upward trends appear in the Southern North Sea, Channel and Northern Bay of Biscay. For sediments, significantly downward trends are observed in the Irish Sea, Northern North Sea and Southern North Sea.

The Irish Sea shows potential for reaching good environmental status within 10-20 years, and the Celtic Sea will probably achieve good status in 10 years. However, despite decreasing trends, the Iberian Sea will likely not reach good status within the next 20 years. Increasing mercury trends in other regions provide no indication of improvement in environmental status.",,"The provided context does not contain information about how climate change impacts species, habitats and ecosystems. The context focuses exclusively on hazardous substances assessment using the CHASE (Contaminants Hazard Assessment and Scoring of Ecosystem health) methodology to evaluate chemical contamination in marine sediments and biota across OSPAR subregions.

The context contains detailed findings about chemical contamination status and trends, including that mercury status is not good in any of the 12 subregions for biota, only half of sediment subregions achieve ""good"" status, and only three of 12 biota areas are in good status. It presents specific trend data showing significant decreases in contamination in some regions like the Irish Sea, Iberian Sea and Celtic Sea, while other regions show upward trends. The analysis includes projections that the Celtic Sea will probably achieve good status in 10 years and the Irish Sea is close to good status, but the Iberian Sea will not reach good status in the next 20 years despite decreasing trends.

However, none of this chemical contamination data addresses climate change impacts on marine life. The context mentions climate change only once in passing reference to resilience but provides no analysis of temperature changes, ocean acidification effects, species distribution shifts, habitat modifications, ecosystem disruptions, or other climate-related impacts on marine organisms and their environments. To answer the question about climate change impacts on species, habitats and ecosystems, different source material focused on climate science rather than chemical contamination assessment would be required.",,"Based on the provided context, one significant knowledge gap is identified in relation to climate change, though the context primarily focuses on hazardous substances assessment rather than climate change specifically.

The key gap identified concerns the CHASE methodology used for hazardous substances assessment. The CHASE tool's effectiveness depends on maintaining the same protection level between individual indicators' target values, creating a critical balance between the number of indicators included and the assessment outcome. When more indicators are developed in the future, careful balancing will be needed between the number of different types of substances (metals versus organic substances, individual compounds versus compound groups).

The context reveals substantial data gaps affecting assessment reliability. Some contaminant ratios are unavailable in certain regions due to lack of data, requiring statistical modeling to fill missing values using available data from other regions. Only regions with data for more than half the indicators are included in final results, excluding areas like the Gulf of Cadiz and Norwegian Sea where only limited measurements exist.

The context focuses entirely on the CHASE (Combined Hazardous Substances Assessment) methodology for evaluating hazardous substances in marine sediments and biota across OSPAR regions.

The context presents technical details about the CHASE assessment method, which integrates indicators by adding ratios of measured concentration to target values divided by the square root of the number of indicators. Results show that only one of seven sub-regions achieved good ecological status for sediments, while three of thirteen sub-regions achieved good status for biota. Time trend analysis revealed slightly downward trends for sediments, with significant improvements in the Irish Sea, Northern North Sea, and Southern North Sea. For biota, significantly decreasing trends occurred in the Irish Sea and Iberian Sea, but upward trends were observed in the Southern North Sea, Channel, and Northern Bay of Biscay.

The document identifies methodological research needs, including developing better balance between indicator numbers and outcomes when more indicators are developed, and Denmark's recommendation that future implementation should preferably be based on Environmental Quality Standards values rather than current OSPAR EAC and ERL values.

The document positions climate change as one of the key stressors affecting marine environments in the North-East Atlantic.

However, the context provided focuses primarily on the CONnECT study examining contaminants of emerging concern rather than detailed climate change analysis. The references to climate change are brief and contextual, identifying it as a pressure on marine systems that necessitates resilience planning, but the document does not provide specific climate data, impacts, projections, or detailed findings about climate change effects in the OSPAR maritime area.

The report mentions climate change in conjunction with ocean acidification as threats that the North-East Atlantic should be resilient to, but does not elaborate on specific climate impacts, temperature changes, sea level rise, or other climate-related parameters. The document's primary focus is on chemical contamination screening rather than climate science, so it lacks the comprehensive climate change analysis that would typically be found in dedicated climate assessment reports.

The OSPAR reports characterize climate change threats as ""emerging,"" indicating they are relatively new or increasingly recognized concerns for marine environmental management.

The context presents climate change as one of multiple stressors affecting marine ecosystems, working in conjunction with anthropogenic contaminants that reach the marine environment from both terrestrial and sea-based sources including shipping, fishing, oil and gas exploration and extraction, mineral extraction, and offshore energy development.

The reports acknowledge that existing monitoring programmes, while providing valuable provisions against pollution of marine waters by chemical substances through legislation and conventions, cannot fully address the complete range of substances present in the environment. This limitation becomes particularly relevant when considering how climate change may interact with or exacerbate chemical contamination issues.

Ocean acidification is specifically mentioned as a climate-related pressure alongside broader climate change impacts. The reports indicate that marine ecosystems need to be resilient to both climate change and ocean acidification to maintain their health and biodiversity.

The available context does not provide specific details about the mechanisms, magnitude, or projected impacts of climate change threats on the OSPAR Maritime Area. The treatment of climate change appears to be at a high level, positioning it as a recognized pressure requiring consideration in marine environmental management rather than providing detailed scientific analysis of climate-related impacts, trends, or adaptation strategies.

However, no specific mechanisms, data, or detailed findings about climate change impacts on marine species, habitats, or ecosystems are provided.

The available context extensively documents chemical contamination findings, including the detection of 125 contaminants in 50 biota samples across the OSPAR maritime area, with molluscs showing a wider range of pollutants compared to fish. The study analyzed over 67,000 organic pollutants using target and suspect screening methodologies across 52 samples from 11 OSPAR contracting parties. Risk assessments identified multiple compounds exceeding ecotoxicological thresholds, with regularly monitored PAHs (pyrene, anthracene, and chrysene) exceeding threshold values in 35, 29, and 27 samples respectively.

While this chemical contamination data provides valuable information about anthropogenic pressures on marine ecosystems, it does not address the specific climate change impacts requested.

The context does not explicitly discuss gaps related to climate change monitoring or research. Instead, the document focuses primarily on gaps in contaminant monitoring and assessment methodologies. The identified gaps relate to:

Targeted monitoring programmes cannot deliver information on the myriad range of substances that may be present in the marine environment, as they focus only on specific priority substance lists. This limitation prevents comprehensive assessment of contaminants of emerging concern (CECs) that may pose significant risks.

Analytical and methodological gaps include the need for continued development of cost-effective lower limits of detection and sensitivity in catch-all screening methods. The report identifies requirements for ongoing evaluation of ecotoxicological threshold values and further experimental toxicity evidence to support risk assessment outcomes.

Development of common sampling and sample handling approaches is needed to minimize potential unintended contamination of samples and provide additional confidence in assessments. Enhanced matrix coverage is recommended, including additional sediments, passive samplers, fish, and higher trophic level species across OSPAR countries to support more conclusive risk assessments.

The document recommends ongoing research and development of methodologies, detection limits, and focused ecotoxicological threshold values. However, these gaps are specifically related to chemical contaminant monitoring rather than climate change research or monitoring gaps.",,"The provided context does not contain explicit recommendations specifically related to climate change action or climate change research priorities.

All other assessments,Trends in deposition of heavy metals to the OSPAR maritime area in the period 1990-2019,OK,p00897_emep_e_trends_in_heavy_metals,"The provided context focuses on atmospheric heavy metals modeling and monitoring data, but contains extremely limited information specifically about climate change. The OSPAR report discusses extensive atmospheric modeling of heavy metals (cadmium, lead, mercury) deposition from 1990-2019, but climate change appears only tangentially in the analysis.

The only direct climate change reference states that OSPAR's vision includes a North-East Atlantic Ocean that is ""resilient to climate change and ocean acidification."" However, the document provides no substantive analysis of climate change impacts, projections, or findings.

Meteorological data underpinning the heavy metals modeling comes from ERA-Interim re-analysis data from the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts for 1990-2018 simulations. The analysis identifies meteorological conditions as one factor affecting inter-annual changes in pollutant deposition, noting that ""sharp inter-annual changes do not correlate with variations of anthropogenic, secondary emissions or meteorological conditions"" at some stations. Changes in annual precipitation sums due to meteorological data updates affected modeled deposition estimates, contributing to 10-30% decreases in mean deposition across most OSPAR regions compared to previous studies.

For mercury specifically, deposition over the Arctic Ocean increased between 1995-2005 due to ""inter-annual variation of meteorological conditions,"" then decreased between 2005-2015. The eastern part of one region showed lower deposition in 2005 than 2015 ""due to higher precipitation sums in 2015 compared to 2005.""

The analysis acknowledges uncertainties in model parameterizations include meteorological fields as input data, but provides no climate change-specific findings, trends, or projections. The document's focus remains entirely on heavy metals atmospheric transport and deposition patterns rather than climate impacts or climate science.",,"The provided context does not address threats or pressures specifically related to climate change. The document focuses entirely on atmospheric deposition of heavy metals (lead, cadmium, and mercury) in the OSPAR Maritime Area from 1990-2019, examining emission sources, deposition patterns, and long-term trends.

The context covers heavy metal contamination as an environmental pressure, showing that atmospheric pathways provide one-fifth to two-thirds of total heavy metal input to the marine environment. Mercury deposition to the Greater North Sea decreased by 45% between 1990 and 2019, while deposition to the Celtic Seas and Bay of Biscay decreased by 34% and 27%, respectively. Heavy metals bioaccumulate in food webs and cause harm to marine life, entering through direct discharges, riverine inputs, and atmospheric deposition.

The document extensively analyzes emission trends, spatial distribution patterns, source-receptor relationships, and model validation against monitoring data. It examines contributions from OSPAR Contracting Parties versus global sources, with global anthropogenic and secondary emissions dominating in remote regions due to relatively low contemporary mercury emissions in Europe.

However, the context contains no discussion of climate change impacts, ocean acidification effects, temperature changes, sea level rise, changing precipitation patterns, extreme weather events, or other climate-related pressures on the marine environment. While climate change is mentioned once in an organizational vision statement, no substantive analysis of climate threats or pressures is provided in the technical content available.",,"The provided context does not contain information about how climate change impacts species, habitats and ecosystems.

The document focuses on heavy metal pollution assessment, covering atmospheric transport modeling, deposition flux calculations, source-receptor relationships, and comparison with observational data from monitoring stations. Heavy metals are identified as toxic to plants, animals and microorganisms, with the ability to bioaccumulate in food webs and cause harm to marine life, but this represents pollution impacts rather than climate change effects.

The document instead identifies significant measurement, modeling, and data gaps related to heavy metal atmospheric deposition monitoring in the OSPAR maritime area.

The context reveals several critical gaps in the monitoring and assessment system. Time series data often contain substantial gaps due to missing or incorrect measurements, with annual data excluded from analysis when completeness falls below 50%. These measurement gaps create incomplete temporal records for evaluating long-term pollution trends.

Modeling uncertainties represent another major gap category. National emission data uncertainties reach hundreds of percent - Danish lead and cadmium emission estimates carry uncertainties of approximately 500% and 365% respectively, while most other countries report uncertainties in the tens of percent range. Model parameterizations for physical and chemical processes contain significant uncertainties, particularly for wind re-suspension processes. Secondary emissions estimates, including natural mercury emissions and wind re-suspension of lead and cadmium, are subject to high uncertainties despite being important components of atmospheric heavy metal releases.

Mercury measurements present specific gaps. The most recent field intercomparison of mercury measurements occurred in 2004, indicating a substantial temporal gap in quality assurance. Laboratory intercomparisons only account for analytical uncertainties while sampling, storage, and shipping uncertainties remain unaccounted for.

Spatial coverage gaps exist where only portions of OSPAR Regions I and V are covered by the monitoring grid, requiring coarser global-scale modeling to fill these areas. This creates inconsistencies at regional boundaries that require technical workarounds.

The report demonstrates that these various gaps contribute to discrepancies between modeled and observed concentrations, with model performance varying substantially between monitoring stations and affecting the reliability of pollution trend assessments across the OSPAR maritime area.",,"Based on the provided OSPAR report context, there are no specific recommendations regarding climate change, nor explicit mentions of issues requiring further investigation or research related to climate change. The report focuses primarily on atmospheric deposition of heavy metals (cadmium, lead, and mercury) to the North-East Atlantic Ocean from 1990-2019.

However, the report does identify several areas requiring additional research and investigation related to atmospheric modeling and heavy metal deposition:

Sharp inter-annual variations in measurements that do not correlate with anthropogenic emissions or meteorological conditions may be caused by measurement uncertainties, requiring additional evaluation. Model parameterization of wind re-suspension contains significant uncertainties. Uncertainties in emission parameters including spatial distribution, seasonal variation, emission heights, and chemical speciation of mercury emissions are not fully reported by countries and contribute to overall modeling uncertainty.

Secondary emissions estimates, including natural/legacy mercury emissions and wind re-suspension of lead and cadmium, are subject to high uncertainties. Laboratory intercomparison tests provide only analytical components of measurement uncertainties while other sources like sampling, storage, and shipping remain unaccounted.

The report notes that model calculations based entirely on anthropogenic emissions substantially underestimate observed concentrations at monitoring stations, indicating the importance of secondary emissions that are poorly quantified. Discrepancies between modeled and observed values stem from three main uncertainty sources: anthropogenic emission data and secondary emission estimates, model parameterizations and input data, and measurement data uncertainties.

It details how emissions of lead, cadmium, and mercury from OSPAR Contracting Parties decreased by 96%, 73%, and 83% respectively during the evaluated period, and how these reductions led to corresponding decreases in atmospheric deposition across the maritime area.

However, none of this heavy metals research provides information about ocean acidification processes, trends, impacts, or measurements. Ocean acidification, which involves the absorption of atmospheric CO2 by seawater leading to decreased ocean pH, is an entirely separate marine chemistry issue from heavy metal contamination. The context is insufficient to answer questions about ocean acidification, as the document appears to be a specialized technical report focused exclusively on atmospheric heavy metal inputs rather than carbonate chemistry or pH changes in marine waters.",,"The provided context does not address ocean acidification impacts on species, habitats, and ecosystems.

Heavy metals are identified as toxic to plants, animals, and microorganisms, with the ability to bioaccumulate in food webs and cause harm to marine life. These pollutants are multi-organ toxicants affecting neurological, cardiovascular, renal, gastrointestinal, hematological, and reproductive systems.

The UK considers climate change a critical threat requiring urgent action and investment to prevent future deterioration in water environment quality. Mediterranean countries face particularly severe impacts, with IPCC projections indicating serious climate change including variations in precipitation, river flows, and likely increases in the intensity and frequency of droughts and floods.

Spain has established the National Climate Change Adaptation Plan (PNACC) 2021-2030 as its framework for building adaptive responses, with dedicated focus on water and water resources. Portugal, identified as one of Europe's most vulnerable countries to climate impacts, prioritizes adapting and mitigating climate variations, particularly regarding floods, droughts, and water supply to populations. The Loire-Brittany basin developed a climate change adaptation plan in 2018 addressing quality, quantity, aquatic environments, flooding, marine submersion, and governance.

Specific observed and projected impacts include flow changes in the Scheldt River, where average annual flow has decreased by 1.12 m³/s (0.74%) since 1990. Norwegian regions face predictions of increased intense rainfall leading to soil erosion, bank erosion, higher summer temperatures, and reduced summer precipitation, which will increase eutrophication risks and harmful algae blooms. Climate change affects pollution load transport, with loads strongly correlating with flood and drought peaks.

Adaptation strategies focus on water retention, wetland restoration for climate resilience, and measures to protect urban centers from flooding.

Climate change significantly influences flows and pollution loads, with the majority of rivers in the Scheldt basin and coastal area not expected to reach good ecological status by 2027.

In Norway, climate change predictions indicate increased and more intense rainfall that will increase soil erosion and river bank erosion. Higher summer temperatures combined with less summer rainfall will increase eutrophication and harmful algae bloom risks in lakes and coastal areas. These changes particularly threaten the deteriorating Oslo Fjord ecosystem.

Mediterranean countries face especially severe impacts. According to IPCC assessments, these regions will experience serious climate change with variations in precipitation and river flows, plus increased intensity and frequency of droughts and floods. Portugal and Spain are identified as among Europe's most vulnerable countries to climate impacts, with priorities focused on adapting to floods, droughts, and water supply challenges.

Climate adaptation plans are being developed across multiple basins. The Loire-Brittany basin created its adaptation plan in 2018 addressing quality, quantity, aquatic environments, flooding, marine submersion, and governance. Spain's National Climate Change Adaptation Plan 2021-2030 provides the framework for building adaptive responses, with dedicated focus on water resources.

Updated River Basin Management Plans consistently identify climate change as exacerbating existing problems with nutrient retention, agricultural pressures, and water quality deterioration. Combined with demographic and economic pressures, climate consequences make achieving good water status by 2027 unlikely across multiple basins.",,"Climate change significantly impacts species, habitats and ecosystems across the OSPAR Maritime Area through multiple interconnected pathways. In Norway, climate change predictions indicate increased and more intense rainfall will increase soil and riverbank erosion, while higher summer temperatures and reduced summer precipitation will increase eutrophication and harmful algae bloom risks in lakes and coastal areas. The Oslo Fjord ecosystem faces particular concern under these conditions.

Mediterranean countries experience the most severe climate change impacts, with expected variations in precipitation and river flows, plus increased intensity and frequency of droughts and floods. These changes directly modify and alter ecosystems, including water-related terrestrial ecosystems, and create impediments to free fish movement.

Climate change exacerbates eutrophication in main rivers and transitional/coastal waters, creating risks to water quality. The combination of changing weather conditions affects nutrient loading patterns - high precipitation leads to higher flows and increased waterborne nitrogen and phosphorus inputs, while drought periods show opposite effects. Annual variations in total nitrogen and phosphorus inputs correlate directly with these weather conditions.

Ecosystem recovery faces additional challenges from climate-induced changes. Recovery from eutrophication takes extended time due to biological lag effects and climate-influenced groundwater nitrogen inputs. Agricultural soil leaching, representing at least 70% of total nitrate flows, becomes more problematic as climate change affects water retention capabilities.

Successful climate adaptation proves key to reducing nutrient and hazardous substance inputs. Management strategies now focus on wetland restoration for biodiversity and climate resilience, water retention in catchments, and maintaining ecosystem functionality to improve resilience against climate impacts.",,"The OSPAR report identifies several significant gaps in relation to climate change across monitoring, data, and knowledge areas.

**Hydrological Data Gaps**

Hydrological data are crucial for load calculations, trend analyses, and assessing developments over time due to changing climatic conditions, yet these data are not always monitored at RID sampling stations, requiring up- or down-scaling adjustments. Flow data gaps create anomalies in trend analyses, exemplified by a gap in 2007 flow data that caused an anomalous dip in normalized inputs for one catchment.

**Monitoring and Data Coverage Limitations**

The coverage of monitored land by rivers varies between contracting parties, creating different proportions of unmonitored areas and varying methods for estimating inputs from these areas. Some parties do not report inputs from unmonitored areas at all. Different spatial aggregations hamper data exchange, as OSPAR areas do not always match Water Framework Directive river basin districts or subunits. Data gaps in time series prevent trend analyses before certain periods, such as 2010 for some catchments, limiting the ability to assess longer-term climate-related changes.

**Knowledge and Assessment Gaps**

Clear impact assessments linking climate change pressures to environmental effects are rare or difficult to make, as both pressures and effects must substantially change to demonstrate causation. The report notes that reducing gaps and uncertainties should continue as a key priority for all contracting parties.

**Predictive and Management Gaps**

Climate change impacts on flows, pollution loads, eutrophication risks, and extreme weather events are acknowledged as significant future challenges, yet specific quantitative assessments and adaptation measures remain limited across many river basins and coastal areas in the OSPAR Maritime Area.",,"The report identifies several key climate change recommendations and research needs:

**Management Recommendations:**
River Basin Management Plans 2022-2027 must integrate climate change as a central challenge requiring urgent action and investment to prevent water environment deterioration. Updated UK plans specifically identify climate change as critical, requiring measures to increase resilience to climate impacts through protected areas, improved water body status, and sustainable abstraction practices.

**National Framework Implementation:**
Spain's National Climate Change Adaptation Plan (PNACC) 2021-2030 serves as the reference framework for generating knowledge and building adaptive responses, with dedicated focus on water resources. Portugal, identified as among Europe's most vulnerable countries to climate impacts, prioritizes adapting and mitigating climate variations affecting floods, droughts, and population water supply.

**Basin-Specific Adaptation Measures:**
The Loire-Brittany basin developed a 2018 climate change adaptation plan addressing five issues: water quality, quantity, aquatic environments, flooding, marine submersion, and governance. Management plans emphasize balancing agricultural productivity with wetland restoration for climate resilience and biodiversity protection.

**Research and Investigation Needs:**
Climate change impacts on hydrological data require continuous assessment for load calculations and trend analyses. Norway faces predicted increased rainfall intensity causing soil erosion, river bank erosion, higher summer temperatures, and reduced summer precipitation - potentially increasing eutrophication and harmful algae bloom risks. Mediterranean countries expect serious climate change with precipitation variations, altered river flows, and increased drought and flood intensity/frequency.

**Monitoring Requirements:**
Further investigation needed on climate-nutrient dynamics relationships, with emphasis on reducing data gaps and uncertainties. Successful climate adaptation requires better understanding of how climate variations mobilize hazardous substances during flood events.",,"The provided context contains minimal information specifically about ocean acidification. Ocean acidification is mentioned only twice in identical vision statements on page 114, which describe a goal for ""a clean, healthy and biologically diverse North-East Atlantic Ocean, which is productive, used sustainably and resilient to climate change and ocean acidification.""

The report does not contain any scientific findings, data, measurements, trends, or analysis related to ocean acidification itself. Instead, the document focuses extensively on waterborne and atmospheric inputs of nutrients and metals to the sea, with detailed coverage of eutrophication, nitrogen and phosphorus inputs, heavy metal contamination, and various pollution sources.

Climate change is referenced throughout as a critical challenge requiring urgent action, with updated plans considering it essential to limit future water environment deterioration. The document notes that climate change affects precipitation patterns, with potential consequences for eutrophication and harmful algae blooms. Mediterranean countries are expected to experience serious climate impacts including precipitation variations and increased drought and flood intensity.

However, none of these climate-related discussions specifically address ocean acidification processes, impacts, measurements, or mitigation strategies. The report's scientific content centers on nutrient pollution pathways, reduction measures showing 76% total reduction in certain inputs since 1990, atmospheric nitrogen deposition constituting roughly half of total nitrogen inputs to the OSPAR Maritime Area, and various case studies of eutrophication recovery efforts.

The context provided is insufficient to answer questions about ocean acidification comprehensively, as this topic falls outside the report's primary focus on nutrient and metal inputs.",,"Based on the provided context, I cannot provide a comprehensive analysis of how Ocean Acidification specifically impacts species, habitats and ecosystems. The context consists entirely of passages from OSPAR reports that focus on waterborne and atmospheric inputs of nutrients and metals to marine environments, eutrophication, and associated ecosystem impacts.

Ocean acidification is mentioned only twice in the context - both times as brief references to resilience against this pressure rather than detailed analysis of its impacts. The available content primarily addresses eutrophication effects, which are distinct from ocean acidification impacts.

The context does provide extensive information about ecosystem impacts from eutrophication and nutrient pollution. For example, nitrogen enrichment in Solent estuaries contributed to historic eutrophication over several decades with adverse environmental and ecological consequences. Climate change combined with higher temperatures and altered precipitation patterns increases eutrophication risk and harmful algae blooms in lakes and coastal areas. The Oslo Fjord ecosystem is deteriorating rapidly due to nutrient inputs from sewage and agriculture. Recovery from eutrophication demonstrates that ecosystem restoration is possible but takes time due to biological time lags.

However, these impacts relate to excess nutrient inputs causing eutrophication rather than the chemical changes to seawater pH and carbonate chemistry that characterize ocean acidification. Ocean acidification has distinct mechanisms and impacts on marine species, particularly calcifying organisms, coral reefs, and marine food webs, but this information is not present in the provided context focused on nutrient and metal inputs to marine systems.",,38,1,39

All indicator assessments,"Abundance, composition and trends of beach litter",OK,p00881_beach_litter_indicator_assessment_qsr2023,"The OSPAR report discusses climate change primarily in the context of weather phenomena affecting beach litter monitoring and assessment. Weather phenomena can influence litter deposition patterns, and transboundary transport of pollution due to wind and currents can exacerbate litter accumulation in specific areas, such as the Skagerrak sub-region along the Sweden coast. The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is specifically identified as a weather phenomenon that should be analyzed in future assessments to determine its influence on litter abundance and trends in beach litter datasets.

The report acknowledges that various environmental factors affect beach litter dynamics, including tides, waves, currents, winds, and the buoyancy properties of different litter items, which influence transport mechanisms and deposition patterns. Between survey periods, litter items can be buried, washed away, or blown away by subsequent tides and winds, while strong wave action can cause buried items to resurface.

However, the extent and effect of these weather-related phenomena on beach litter monitoring is currently not well quantified in the OSPAR Area. The report identifies this as a knowledge gap, noting that comprehensive information on environmental conditions needs to be made available for all survey sites in a usable form to improve future assessments.

The context provided focuses primarily on marine litter assessment methodology and findings rather than comprehensive climate change analysis. While weather and oceanographic phenomena are recognized as important factors affecting litter distribution and monitoring, detailed climate change impacts, projections, or broader climate-related findings are not substantively addressed in the available text.",,"The provided context from this OSPAR report primarily focuses on beach litter monitoring and assessment rather than comprehensive climate change threats and pressures. However, several climate-related factors are mentioned that influence marine litter dynamics and monitoring.

Weather phenomena significantly affect litter deposition patterns, with the report identifying this as a knowledge gap requiring further analysis. Specifically, the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is identified as a weather phenomenon that should be analyzed to assess its influence on abundance and trends in beach litter data. The report notes that weather phenomena can influence litter deposition, but their effects on beach litter monitoring are currently not well quantified in the OSPAR Area.

Physical oceanographic processes linked to climate - including tides, waves, currents, and winds - are identified as key transport mechanisms that move litter items between locations and affect their deposition on beaches. Strong wave action can cause buried litter items to resurface, while winds can transport litter items both into the marine environment and onto beaches from adjacent areas.

Hydrodynamic conditions including tides, waves, and currents are recognized as factors that influence the amount of litter deposited on beaches, though these were only briefly considered in the current assessment methodology and require further consideration in future assessments.

The report acknowledges that transboundary transport of pollution due to wind and currents can exacerbate pollution levels in some areas, such as the Skagerrak sub-region, but notes this phenomenon is not well quantified.

The context is insufficient to provide a comprehensive picture of broader climate change threats and pressures, as this report focuses specifically on marine litter assessment rather than comprehensive climate impacts on marine ecosystems.",,"Based on the provided context, climate change impacts on species, habitats and ecosystems cannot be comprehensively addressed. The context consists entirely of a beach litter monitoring assessment from the OSPAR Maritime Area, focusing on marine debris abundance, composition, and trends from 2015-2020.

The only reference to climate change appears in relation to weather phenomena effects on litter deposition. The North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) is identified as a weather phenomenon that should be analyzed for its influence on beach litter abundance and trends, but no actual analysis or findings about climate change impacts are presented.

The context documents beach litter pollution across OSPAR regions, showing significant decreases in total litter counts ranging from 9 to 12 items per 100 meters per year and plastic counts decreasing 8 to 11 items per 100 meters per year from 2015-2020. Weather conditions, tides, waves, and currents are mentioned as factors affecting litter transport and deposition, with strong wave action capable of resurfacing buried litter items. However, these references relate to litter movement rather than climate change impacts on marine life.

The assessment covers 114 survey sites across Arctic Waters, Greater North Sea, Celtic Seas, and Bay of Biscay regions, but focuses exclusively on pollution monitoring rather than biological or ecological responses to climate change. While the context mentions environmental impacts of plastic fragmentation increasing ingestion risks as litter breaks into smaller pieces, this addresses pollution impacts rather than climate change effects on species and ecosystems.",,"Based on the provided context, several gaps exist in relation to climate change impacts on marine litter assessment, though climate change is not directly discussed as a primary focus. The analysis identifies weather phenomena as a significant knowledge gap requiring attention.

Weather phenomena can influence litter deposition patterns, yet their effects on beach litter data are currently not well quantified in the OSPAR Area. Specifically, the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) should be analyzed to assess its influence on abundance and trends in beach litter datasets. This represents a critical gap since weather patterns directly affect how marine litter reaches and remains on coastlines.

Environmental conditions more broadly present data gaps that hinder precise assessment capabilities. More comprehensive information on environmental conditions needs to be made available for all survey sites in a useable form. Currently, differences in topography, geography of beaches, and hydrodynamic conditions including tides, waves, and currents were only succinctly considered in aggregation methods but require further consideration in future assessments.

The assessment acknowledges that litter dynamics are complex - items can be buried, washed away, or blown by subsequent tides and winds, and strong wave action can cause buried items to resurface. However, the systematic analysis of how changing weather patterns and environmental conditions affect these processes remains insufficient.

These gaps are particularly problematic given that beach litter serves as a proxy for marine environment pollution overall. Without understanding how climate-related environmental changes influence litter distribution and detection, the effectiveness of pollution reduction measures and trend assessments may be compromised. The limited data availability in the Arctic Waters Region, where climate change impacts are often most pronounced, further compounds these analytical limitations.",,"Based on the provided context, there are no direct recommendations regarding climate change measures or climate-related research needs in this OSPAR beach litter assessment report. The document focuses specifically on marine litter monitoring and assessment rather than climate change mitigation or adaptation strategies.

However, the report does identify several weather and climate-related research gaps that require investigation. Weather phenomena can influence litter deposition patterns, and their effects on beach litter monitoring are currently not well quantified in the OSPAR Area. The report specifically recommends analyzing the effects of weather phenomena, particularly the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), to assess their influence on abundance and trends in beach litter datasets.

The assessment notes that transboundary transport of pollution due to wind and currents can exacerbate beach litter pollution in areas like the Skagerrak sub-region, particularly on the Swedish coast. While these phenomena are known to occur, their extent and effect on beach litter monitoring requires better quantification.

The report identifies that differences in beach topography, geography, and hydrodynamic conditions (tides, waves, currents) were only briefly considered in the current methodology but need further consideration in future assessments. More comprehensive information on environmental conditions needs to be made available for all survey sites in useable form.

Additionally, the MSFD Technical Group on Marine Litter has planned to develop models to estimate transboundary pollution in the mid-term future, which could help determine the proportion of litter items that originate from outside monitored areas or transfer between OSPAR regions.

The context provided is insufficient to answer questions about broader climate change recommendations, as this report specifically addresses beach litter assessment methodology and findings.",,"Based on the provided context, ocean acidification is only mentioned twice in passing references to resilience goals. The report does not contain any scientific findings, data, measurements, or analysis related to ocean acidification itself.

The context consists entirely of a comprehensive assessment of beach litter in the OSPAR Maritime Area from 2015-2020. The report analyzes marine debris trends, composition, and sources, finding that plastic items represent 94% of beach litter pollution with a median of 194 items per 100 meters. Significant decreases in total and plastic litter counts were observed across the OSPAR Area, ranging from 9 to 12 items per year reduction, with single-use plastics and maritime-related items showing decreases of 2 to 5 items per 100 meters per year in three regions.

The assessment covers litter abundance, distribution patterns across different OSPAR regions, effectiveness of regulatory measures like the EU Single-use Plastics Directive, and monitoring methodology. However, it provides no information about ocean acidification impacts, trends, chemical measurements, pH levels, or related environmental effects in the North-East Atlantic Ocean.

All indicator assessments,Abundance and distribution of cetaceans,OK,p00849_qsr2023_m4_abundance_cetaceans_assessment_v110,"Climate change is addressed primarily in relation to its effects on cetacean distribution patterns in the North-East Atlantic. The analysis reveals several distribution shifts that may be climate-related, though explicit causal linkages are limited.

Harbor porpoises showed a marked southward distribution shift in the Greater North Sea between 1994 and 2005, with increasing numbers in French, Belgian, Dutch and German waters and decreasing numbers in the northern North Sea. This distribution shift is believed related to changes in prey distribution or abundance. Harbor porpoise presence is influenced by oceanographic variables including sea surface temperature, surface salinity, temperature differences within the water column, eddy activity, and current speed.

Minke whales demonstrated evidence of southward distribution shift between 1994 and 2005, with sighting patterns from 2016 surveys indicating this shift has been maintained. Common dolphin sightings in the Greater North Sea are associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation and incursions of warmer water into the Northern North Sea.

Fin whales show associations with moderate sea surface temperature, positive sea level anomaly, and high chlorophyll concentrations in the Bay of Biscay, though data spanning 30 years indicate no changes in their overall distribution. Striped dolphins prefer specific water temperatures (21-24°C in Mediterranean contexts).

The density surface models incorporated sea surface temperature as a key oceanographic variable for predicting cetacean distributions between 2005-2020. Temperature gradients and variability reveal front locations and mixing patterns associated with enhanced primary production and prey aggregations. However, the report provides limited direct discussion of broader climate change impacts or future projections for cetacean populations under changing climate conditions.",,"Based on the provided context, climate change-related threats and pressures on cetaceans manifest primarily through distributional shifts and changes in prey availability. Harbour porpoise distribution showed a marked southern shift in summer within the Greater North Sea between 1994 and 2005, which was confirmed and maintained in 2016. This shift is believed to be related to changes in prey distribution or abundance. 

Temperature changes appear to drive species distribution patterns. Sightings of common dolphins in the Greater North Sea are associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation and the incursion of warmer water into the Northern North Sea. Minke whale distribution shifted south between 1994 and 2005, maintained through 2016. Striped dolphins prefer specific water temperatures (21–24°C in Mediterranean waters) and within the OSPAR Maritime Area are found only in southern Celtic Seas, Bay of Biscay, and Iberian Coast.

Oceanographic variables indirectly influence cetacean presence through determining prey presence and abundance. High eddy kinetic energy relates to development of eddies, upwelling of nutrients and enhanced primary production, which induce prey aggregation. Fin whale densities in Bay of Biscay deep waters are associated with moderate sea surface temperatures, positive sea level anomaly, and high chlorophyll concentrations.

The decrease in long-finned pilot whales in surveyed areas could be due to emigration outside the area, possibly due to spatial variation in prey availability. Several estuaries and enclosed bays historically inhabited by bottlenose dolphins are no longer inhabited, with some losses occurring recently while others happened over a century ago.

However, the impact of these climate-related changes at the population level, independently and in combination with other stressors, is not yet fully understood.",,"Based on the provided context, there is limited direct information about climate change impacts on species, habitats, and ecosystems. The context primarily focuses on cetacean abundance and distribution patterns in the North-East Atlantic Ocean rather than comprehensive climate change effects.

The most relevant climate-related finding involves harbour porpoises, which showed a marked southern shift in summer distribution within the Greater North Sea between 1994 and 2005, confirmed again in 2016. This distributional shift is believed to be related to changes in prey distribution or abundance. Data from smaller scale surveys support this pattern, showing increasing numbers of porpoises in French, Belgian, Dutch, and German waters while decreasing in the northern North Sea.

For short-beaked common dolphins, sightings in the Greater North Sea are associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation and incursion of warmer water into the Northern North Sea. There is evidence that minke whale distribution shifted south between 1994 and 2005, with this pattern maintained through 2016.

The context indicates that cetacean presence is influenced by oceanographic variables including water depth, surface salinity, temperature differences within the water column, eddy activity, and current speed. High eddy kinetic energy relates to nutrient upwelling and enhanced primary production, which induces prey aggregation. Fin whales show higher densities associated with moderate sea surface temperature, positive sea level anomaly, and high chlorophyll concentrations.

However, the context lacks comprehensive information about broader climate change impacts on marine ecosystems, ocean acidification effects, temperature rise measurements, or systematic habitat changes beyond these specific cetacean distribution shifts.",,"The OSPAR report identifies significant knowledge gaps that limit assessment capabilities, particularly regarding climate-related changes in cetacean populations. Several species have no defined Assessment Units, preventing indicator assessments entirely. AU delineation is required to enable consistent monitoring and interpretation of variations in abundance over time.

Data availability remains low to moderate due to substantial gaps in coverage, particularly for offshore areas and winter seasons. Large-scale surveys have been conducted only four times (SCANS in 1994, 2005, 2016; CODA in 2007) and exclusively during summer, resulting in little seasonal information at assessment unit scale. For most species, only two abundance estimates are available, making robust trend assessment impossible - at least three estimates are required over relevant time scales.

Geographic coverage is uneven across the OSPAR Maritime Area, with concentrated effort in the Greater North Sea but comparatively less in offshore areas of Celtic Seas and Bay of Biscay. Environmental coverage analysis reveals shelf areas are relatively well covered, but the Norwegian Trench, offshore Portugal areas, and central Bay of Biscay correspond to extrapolations in environmental space, making model predictions more fragile.

The time series for cetaceans remains too short to assess status relative to both abundance and distribution indicators. More than half of coastal bottlenose dolphin Assessment Units could not be quantitatively assessed due to lack of abundance estimates. Historical data on abundance and distribution are scarce for the vast majority of cetacean species.

Power to detect trends could be improved by increasing frequency of large-scale surveys. Better coordination of smaller-scale surveys across wider areas and seasons is needed to address seasonal variation gaps.",,"Based on the provided context, the OSPAR report does not contain explicit recommendations specifically focused on climate change. The document primarily presents technical assessments of cetacean populations and distribution patterns in the North-East Atlantic, with climate-related findings emerging as observational data rather than targeted recommendations.

The report documents several climate-related phenomena affecting marine mammals. Harbour porpoise distribution has shifted southward within the Greater North Sea between 1994 and 2016, believed to be related to changes in prey distribution or abundance. Short-beaked common dolphin sightings in the Greater North Sea are associated with the North Atlantic Oscillation and warmer water incursions. Minke whale distribution also shifted south between 1994 and 2005, with this pattern maintained through 2016. Fin whale densities correlate with specific oceanographic conditions including moderate sea surface temperature and chlorophyll concentrations.

Key research gaps requiring investigation include understanding sub-lethal stress effects at population levels, both independently and in combination. The assessment reveals substantial coverage gaps resulting in low data availability for offshore areas and winter seasons. Model-based predictions are intrinsically fragile in areas where environmental and geographical extrapolations exceed data coverage, particularly in the Norwegian Trench, offshore Portugal, and central Bay of Biscay.

The report identifies needs for better coordination of smaller-scale surveys across time and space, extension to wider areas, and increased frequency of large-scale surveys to improve statistical power for detecting population trends. Establishing a European Atlantic-wide framework for determining cetacean abundance and trends is identified as a preferred approach for addressing monitoring limitations.",,"The provided context contains only minimal information about ocean acidification. The context mentions ocean acidification twice in identical statements describing resilience to ""climate change and ocean acidification"" in the North-East Atlantic Ocean, but provides no substantive scientific findings, data, or analysis specifically addressing ocean acidification itself.

The context is primarily focused on cetacean abundance and distribution in the OSPAR Maritime Area, covering survey methodologies, population assessments, and various environmental factors affecting marine mammals. While the document discusses oceanographic variables such as sea surface temperature, water depth, salinity, eddy activity, and current speed as factors influencing cetacean distribution, it does not address ocean acidification as a specific pressure or environmental variable.

The OSPAR report focuses exclusively on cetacean abundance and distribution in the North-East Atlantic Ocean, with no discussion of acidification effects.

The context reveals extensive data on cetacean population changes and distribution shifts that may be related to environmental changes, but ocean acidification is not identified as a driver. Harbour porpoise distribution showed a marked southern shift between 1994 and 2005, with increasing numbers in French, Belgian, and Dutch waters and decreasing numbers in the northern North Sea. This shift is attributed to changes in prey distribution or abundance rather than acidification.

Several species show population declines: harbour porpoise abundance declined significantly between 2005 and 2016 in the Celtic and Irish Seas, while the Sado Estuary bottlenose dolphin population continues declining. Long-finned pilot whale abundance decreased in the surveyed area, possibly due to spatial variation in prey availability.

The report identifies multiple human pressures affecting cetaceans, including by-catch, increased shipping, bioaccumulation of persistent hazardous substances, chemical pollution, and noise pollution. These pressures cause negative impacts ranging from increased stress and higher energetic costs to sub-lethal effects on reproduction and immune function, and mortality.

The context focuses entirely on anthropogenic underwater noise pollution, specifically impulsive sound sources in the OSPAR Maritime Area.

The document details how impulsive sound sources from human activities like seismic surveys, construction, and sonar cause various impacts on marine life. These sources cause temporary displacement of small cetaceans such as harbour porpoise, increased physiological stress in fish species like European seabass, and developmental abnormalities in invertebrate larvae. In severe cases, they can cause permanent auditory damage or blast injuries. However, uncertainty exists over whether effects on individual animals translate to population or ecosystem-scale impacts.

The assessment quantifies anthropogenic pressure from impulsive sound across the OSPAR Maritime Area using data from 2015-2019, with data provided by Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, and other countries. The document identifies knowledge gaps regarding source intensity categories and notes that improved reporting will enable assessment of cumulative effects.

The context primarily focuses on underwater noise pollution and its effects on marine life in the OSPAR Maritime Area during 2015-2019.

The substantive findings relate to anthropogenic sound impacts rather than climate change. Impulsive sound sources cause temporary displacement of small cetaceans such as harbour porpoise, increased physiological stress in fish species like European seabass, and developmental abnormalities in invertebrate larvae. In severe cases, these sound sources can cause permanent auditory damage or blast injuries. Marine organisms experience adverse effects over both short timescales (acute effects) and longer periods, ranging from subtle impacts like temporary reduction in hearing sensitivity and physiological stress to obvious responses including overt behavioral changes or death.

The North Sea showed the highest levels of pulse block days during the study period, except in 2017 when Atlantic region activity peaked due to seismic airgun operations. High-frequency sounds propagate less effectively in marine environments than low-frequency sounds, which can travel far in sufficiently deep waters.

A significant knowledge gap exists regarding how effects on individual animals translate to population or ecosystem scales. While growing literature documents anthropogenic sound effects on individual animals, obtaining direct observations of effects on particular ecosystems or populations remains challenging, creating uncertainty about population-level and ecosystem-level impacts.

The document is focused entirely on underwater noise assessment and does not discuss climate change-related knowledge gaps or research needs.

The knowledge gaps identified in this OSPAR report relate exclusively to underwater noise monitoring and assessment methodology. Key gaps include the need to reconsider definitions of source intensity categories in the Impulsive Noise Registry, particularly how to classify source intensity and address reductions from source mitigation technologies. Source intensity information was excluded from the current assessment due to unreliable data quality, with ongoing work to improve reporting robustness.

The assessment faces substantial data availability limitations, with moderate confidence in methodology but low confidence in data availability. Data were not available for all activities and Contracting Parties during 2015-2019, representing only a partial assessment. Known activities remain unaccounted for due to lack of reporting, including unlicensed activities such as acoustic deterrent devices in fish farms, certain geophysical surveys, and classified military sonar operations.

Methodological gaps include challenges in spatial data processing, where up to 33% of reported activity areas may be assigned to adjacent blocks due to polygon data alignment issues with ICES sub-rectangles. The assessment acknowledges uncertainty in translating individual organism effects to population or ecosystem scales, despite growing literature on anthropogenic sound effects on individual animals.

The document contains only a brief aspirational reference to climate change resilience but provides no substantive analysis, data, or identified knowledge gaps specifically related to climate change impacts, adaptation, or mitigation within the marine acoustic environment context.",,"The provided context focuses on underwater noise pollution and impulsive sound sources in marine environments, but does not contain specific climate change recommendations that directly address the user's question.

The context reveals several methodological and research needs related to marine environmental assessment: Source intensity classification systems in the OSPAR Impulsive Noise Registry require fundamental reconsideration, specifically regarding how to classify source intensity and address reductions from source mitigation technologies. Current definitions limit data accuracy and need redefinition according to sound source levels.

Cumulative effects assessment represents a critical knowledge gap requiring improved future reporting capabilities. The assessment methodology shows moderate confidence levels, but data availability confidence remains low, indicating substantial data quality issues that need addressing.

Work is ongoing to improve reporting quality and strengthen source intensity category robustness, as current discretionary reporting by individual countries creates inconsistencies. The assessment deliberately excluded source intensity information until more reliable data becomes available.

A separate OSPAR Common Indicator is being developed to assess risk of impact from impulsive sound sources on marine organisms, complementing current pressure assessments. Uncertainty exists regarding how individual organism effects translate to population and ecosystem scales, representing a significant research gap.

The spatial methodology has been refined to reduce over-estimation of pressure footprints from 180% to 120% of reported areas, though up to 33% of activity areas may still be misassigned to adjacent assessment blocks.

The report presents detailed assessments of noise pollution impacts on harbour porpoise populations from 2015-2019, including exposure indices, risk mapping, and the effectiveness of noise abatement measures. It discusses anthropogenic sound effects on marine organisms, monitoring methodologies, and marine protected area performance. The analysis covers temporal patterns showing peak exposure in August-October, spatial distribution of risks across the North Sea, and quantified reductions in exposure from pile-driving noise controls.

The context lacks any climate change research findings, temperature measurements, sea level data, ocean chemistry changes, species distribution shifts related to warming, or climate impact assessments.

The only direct reference to climate change appears in OSPAR's organizational vision statement, which mentions creating an ocean that is ""resilient to climate change and ocean acidification."" However, the substantive scientific content of the report does not address climate change as a pressure or threat.

The report extensively documents threats from anthropogenic impulsive sound, which includes noise from human activities such as pile driving operations for offshore windfarms, seismic airgun surveys, shipping, construction, and intentional sound production for seabed or water column surveying. Harbour porpoises experience displacement of around 20 km from unabated pile driving operations, 12 km from abated operations, and up to 12 km from seismic surveys.

The assessment reveals that 13% of harbour porpoise habitat was exposed to impulsive sound when weighted for habitat use frequency, with seasonal variance showing greatest risk during August-October months. Maximum daily exposed habitat area reached 10% in September 2015, while winter months typically showed less than 2.5% exposure.

The report identifies physiological stress, temporary hearing sensitivity reduction, behavioral responses, and potential death as adverse effects from sound exposure. However, uncertainty exists regarding how individual-level effects translate to population or ecosystem-scale impacts. The assessment acknowledges that population-level risk assessment must consider additional stressors beyond anthropogenic sound, but climate change is not specifically identified or discussed as one of these stressors in the provided context.",,"Based on the provided context, I cannot comprehensively answer how climate change impacts species, habitats and ecosystems. The context primarily focuses on anthropogenic impulsive noise pollution impacts on marine mammals, particularly harbour porpoise in the North Sea, rather than climate change effects.

The context does contain limited climate change references. Climate change and ocean acidification are mentioned as environmental pressures that marine ecosystems need to be resilient against. However, no specific impacts, mechanisms, data, or findings about climate change effects on species, habitats, or ecosystems are presented.

Instead, the context provides detailed analysis of noise pollution impacts on marine life. Anthropogenic impulsive sound causes temporary displacement of small cetaceans like harbour porpoise, with displacement occurring around 20 km from unabated pile driving operations for offshore windfarms. The sound pollution produces both subtle effects (temporary hearing sensitivity reduction, physiological stress) and obvious effects (overt behavioral responses, death) over short timescales and longer periods. Increased physiological stress has been documented in European seabass, and developmental abnormalities occur in invertebrate larvae exposed to impulsive noise.

The assessment methodology tracks risk of impact on selected species based on their exposure to noise pollution, which increases the risk of population-level consequences. However, uncertainty exists over how individual animal effects translate to population or ecosystem levels. The assessment found that 13% of harbour porpoise habitat in the North Sea was exposed to noise pollution, with exposure greatest during August-October periods and most widespread in 2015 compared to subsequent years.",,"The provided context does not contain substantive discussion about gaps specifically in relation to climate change.

The only reference to climate change appears in a single organizational vision statement about achieving ""a North-East Atlantic Ocean which is productive, used sustainably and resilient to climate change and ocean acidification,"" but this provides no analytical content about climate-related gaps.

The gaps discussed throughout the document relate entirely to acoustic impact assessments: uncertainties in modelled animal density estimates that translate into assessment uncertainties; incomplete reporting of impulsive sound activities including unlicensed operations like acoustic deterrent devices, certain geophysical surveys, and classified military sonar; moderate confidence in methodology but low confidence in data availability; limited marine mammal monitoring that constrains data quality; and lack of specific dose-response data for different species-source combinations that would enable more precise impact risk assessments.

The knowledge gaps identified focus on expanding species coverage beyond harbour porpoises to include other marine mammals, fish, and invertebrates, plus improving temporal and spatial resolution of species distribution data. However, none of these identified gaps or uncertainties are framed in relation to climate change impacts, climate adaptation needs, or climate-related research priorities.

This OSPAR report focuses exclusively on assessing the risk of impact from anthropogenic impulsive sound on marine mammals, particularly harbour porpoise in the North Sea.

The document's substantive content addresses underwater noise pollution from human activities such as shipping, construction, and seabed surveying. The assessment found that overall exposure of North Sea harbour porpoise to impulsive noise pollution was greatest in 2015, with notable seasonal variance showing greatest risk during August-October. Thirteen percent of harbour porpoise habitat was exposed when weighted for usage frequency, though the actual number of individual animals exposed may be much higher due to multiple exposures across different areas.

The research gaps and future investigations identified in the report relate entirely to underwater noise assessment improvements, including: expanding assessments to additional marine mammal species and fish or invertebrate species; obtaining more specific dose-response data for different noise sources; improving reporting completeness to reduce uncertainty in impulsive sound activity data; and developing better understanding of population-level consequences from acoustic disturbance when combined with other stressors.

All indicator assessments,Changes in phytoplankton biomass and zooplankton abundance,OK,p00941_ph1fw5_phytoplankton_zooplankton_communities_qsr2023,"Climate change acts as a major driver of plankton community changes throughout the North-East Atlantic through multiple interconnected mechanisms. Atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, identified as the main driver of global warming, directly affects marine pH levels, which in turn impacts phytoplankton communities that ingest Dissolved Inorganic Carbon for growth and reproduction.

Rising sea surface temperatures represent the most significant climate-related pressure on plankton communities. Increased temperatures drive declining abundances of dinoflagellates, large and small copepods in coastal habitats, while simultaneously promoting increasing meroplankton abundance in coastal and shelf areas of the Greater North Sea. Temperature increases also cause declining trends in holoplankton in both coastal areas (linked to decreasing pH) and shelf regions. In oceanic and beyond-shelf habitats, large and small copepods experience declines specifically linked to increasing temperatures.

Temperature effects extend beyond direct impacts through enhanced water column stratification, which creates resulting nutrient limitation affecting plankton communities. These temperature impacts occur most frequently in shelf and oceanic pelagic habitats, with the Eastern North Sea showing particularly strong links between rising temperatures and increasing meroplankton abundance.

Climate change influences marine ecosystems through both external pressures (precipitation, wind speed) and internal pressures (pH, water temperature). Ocean acidification, driven by atmospheric carbon dioxide, contributes to declining holoplankton abundance in coastal areas through pH reductions.

Most plankton lifeforms - including diatoms, dinoflagellates, holoplankton, fish larvae/eggs, and both large and small copepods - are declining in abundance throughout the North-East Atlantic. Climate-driven changes in plankton abundances over short timescales create immediate consequences for higher trophic levels, while gradual changes over decades indicate long-term shifts in ecosystem functioning, making plankton communities essential indicators of climate-driven environmental change.",,"Climate change represents a major pressure on marine plankton communities in the North-East Atlantic, manifesting through multiple interconnected environmental changes. Increased sea surface temperatures are directly linked to declining abundances of plankton lifeforms, particularly small and large copepods in the Atlantic Ocean, with temperature impacts most frequently detected in shelf and oceanic pelagic habitats. Temperature increases also drive increasing meroplankton abundance in the Eastern North Sea and declining abundance trends in dinoflagellates and copepods in coastal habitats.

Rising temperatures create secondary effects through greater water column stratification, resulting in nutrient limitation that further impacts plankton communities. Ocean acidification, driven by atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, causes pH reductions that are linked to declining holoplankton abundance in coastal areas. pH changes directly affect primary production as phytoplankton require dissolved inorganic carbon for growth and reproduction.

Climate change influences both external environmental pressures (precipitation, wind speed) and internal marine conditions (pH, water temperature) that determine plankton community structure. Changes in the nitrogen-to-phosphorus ratio, driven by reduced phosphorous concentrations, affect diatom and dinoflagellate abundance in coastal regions. Meroplankton increasingly dominate shelf areas in response to temperature changes, while simultaneous declines in holopankton populations reflect temperature-driven ecosystem shifts.

These climate-driven changes cascade through marine food webs, as plankton form the base of marine ecosystems supporting higher trophic levels including shellfish, fish, and seabirds. The assessment identifies knowledge gaps requiring further research into direct mechanistic links between environmental variables and plankton abundance changes.",,"Climate change impacts species, habitats and ecosystems primarily through temperature-driven changes that cascade through marine food webs. Most plankton lifeforms, including diatoms, dinoflagellates, holoplankton, fish larvae/eggs, and large and small copepods are declining in abundance throughout the North-East Atlantic. Increased sea surface temperatures are linked to declining abundances of plankton lifeforms, particularly small and large copepods in the Atlantic, with impacts most frequently detected in shelf and oceanic pelagic habitats.

Temperature increases directly affect different habitat types: in coastal habitats, declining abundance trends in dinoflagellates and large and small copepods are linked to temperature increases, while in shelf and oceanic regions, holoplankton, large and small copepods exhibit decreasing abundance trends linked to temperature increase. Conversely, meroplankton abundance increases in response to rising sea surface temperatures, with change in water temperature strongly linked to increasing meroplankton abundance within the Eastern North Sea.

Beyond direct temperature effects, climate change drives greater stratification and resulting nutrient limitation. Environmental pressures influenced by climate change include precipitation, wind speed, pH, and water temperature variations. Changes in pH, linked to atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations and primary production changes, affect holoplankton abundance in coastal areas.

These plankton community changes have cascading effects since plankton form the base of marine food webs. Changes in plankton abundances over short time scales have immediate consequences for higher trophic levels, while gradual change over decades indicates long-term shifts in ecosystem functioning. The transfer of energy from primary to secondary producers and pathways to top predators are affected through changes in phytoplankton-zooplankton dynamics and gelatinous zooplankton-fish larvae relationships.",,"The OSPAR assessment identifies several critical gaps regarding climate change impacts on plankton communities. Insufficient zooplankton data exists for variable salinity habitats in the Greater North Sea and Celtic Seas, and both phytoplankton and zooplankton data are lacking for variable salinity habitats in the Bay of Biscay and Iberian Coast. Coastal habitat zooplankton data remains underrepresented across the assessment.

A fundamental research gap exists in understanding direct mechanistic links between environmental variable changes and lifeform abundance changes. While the assessment successfully links plankton changes to climate-related pressures like rising temperatures and pH decreases, 78% of the 182 significant abundance trends could not be explained by environmental variable models, indicating substantial knowledge limitations.

The assessment notes that conclusions about climate change impacts could not be made in the previous 2017 assessment due to insufficient investigation of environmental pressures and climate change effects. Although this 2023 assessment addresses some of these gaps by establishing plausible links between environmental pressures and long-term plankton changes, significant uncertainties remain.

Additional gaps include the need for national datasets at finer spatiotemporal scales to establish clearer links between climatic and anthropogenic pressures with pelagic habitat changes. The assessment also lacks examination of ecological consequences of changing lifeform abundance on higher trophic levels. Five-year assessment periods prove insufficient for robust environmental change assessment, limiting detection of climate-driven trends that require longer temporal perspectives to identify gradual changes occurring over decades.",,"Based on the OSPAR report context, the recommendations related to climate change focus on addressing critical research gaps and improving monitoring capabilities to better understand climate-driven changes in marine plankton communities.

The report identifies several key areas requiring further investigation. Direct mechanistic links between environmental variables and plankton lifeform abundance changes need exploration, as current models show that 78% of significant abundance trends lack statistically significant predictive ability based on environmental variables. Research should examine delayed effects by introducing lag into variable selection processes, such as testing how winter nutrient concentrations affect lifeform abundance during growing seasons.

Critical data gaps must be addressed through expanded monitoring programs. The report recommends obtaining high-quality zooplankton data for underrepresented variable salinity habitats in the Greater North Sea, Celtic Seas, and Bay of Biscay regions. Monthly monitoring programmes for pico and nanoplankton should be established to provide data on these relatively data-sparse community components. National datasets need examination at finer spatiotemporal scales to establish clearer links between climatic pressures and changes in pelagic habitats.

The analysis should investigate ecological consequences of changing lifeform abundance on higher trophic levels and examine predation impacts through datasets indicating forage fish density. Research into pico and nanoplankton biological interactions within their environmental contexts requires development, as their ecosystem roles need further investigation for proper classification.

The report emphasizes that five-year assessment periods are insufficient for robust environmental change evaluation due to high inter-annual variability and gradual change rates. Longer temporal extents increase detection capabilities for important plankton community changes. Understanding how increased sea surface temperatures link to declining copepod abundances and rising meroplankton populations remains crucial for predicting climate change impacts on marine ecosystems.",,"The OSPAR report establishes ocean acidification as a significant driver affecting plankton communities through measurable changes in seawater pH. Declining abundance of holoplankton in coastal areas has been linked to decreasing pH levels. pH changes directly affect primary production because phytoplankton ingest Dissolved Inorganic Carbon (DIC) to fuel growth and reproduction, but these changes also connect to atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations - the main driver of global warming and ocean acidification.

In shelf areas, decreasing abundance of both holoplankton and dinoflagellates may be linked to pH reductions, alongside other factors like increases in the nitrogen-to-phosphorus ratio. The report identifies pH as one of the key internal environmental pressures acting on marine environments, alongside water temperature, with many of these pressures influenced indirectly by climate change.

Ocean acidification emerges as a criterion for assessing environmental pressure impacts on plankton communities. The assessment methodology specifically requires that environmental pressures with the greatest influence on observed trends must represent either sea surface temperature, pH, or nutrients, highlighting pH as a primary driver of ecosystem change.

The findings demonstrate that pH variations, linked to both primary production changes and atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, create cascading effects through marine food webs. Since plankton form the base of marine food webs and support higher trophic levels including shellfish, fish, and seabirds, pH-driven changes in plankton communities have broader ecosystem implications across the North-East Atlantic region.",,"Ocean acidification impacts marine ecosystems through several interconnected mechanisms affecting plankton communities that form the base of marine food webs. Declining holoplankton abundance in coastal areas is linked to decreasing pH levels. pH changes directly affect primary production because phytoplankton ingest Dissolved Inorganic Carbon (DIC) for growth and reproduction, while pH is also connected to atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations - the main driver of global warming.

In shelf areas, decreasing abundance of holoplankton and dinoflagellates may be linked to pH reductions alongside increases in the nitrogen-to-phosphorus ratio. These pH-driven changes occur alongside temperature-related impacts, with declining abundance trends in dinoflagellates and large and small copepods in coastal habitats linked to temperature increases. The combined effects demonstrate how ocean acidification works in conjunction with warming to alter plankton community structure.

The ecosystem consequences extend beyond individual species impacts. Changes in plankton communities affect higher food web levels including shellfish, fish, and seabirds, which depend directly or indirectly on plankton. Short-term changes in plankton lifeform abundances can have immediate consequences for higher trophic levels, while gradual changes over decades indicate long-term shifts in ecosystem functioning.

Plankton serve as key indicators of ecosystem state due to their short generational times, small size, and direct dependence on dissolved nutrients, making them well-suited for detecting environmental change. The transfer of energy from primary to secondary producers is altered through changes in phytoplankton and zooplankton populations, affecting overall ecosystem function and marine food web dynamics.",,7,2,16
All indicator assessments,Changes in plankton diversity,OK,p00943_ph3_qsr2023_change_in_plankton_diversity,"Climate change emerges as a significant driver of plankton community changes across OSPAR maritime regions. Sinking mixed layer depth represents a consequence of climate change, while increasing sea surface temperatures (SST) correlate with downward trends in zooplankton communities in coastal habitats of the Bay of Biscay and Iberian Coast. Wind speed increases, potentially linked to climate change, drive zooplankton communities toward atypical compositions in Greater North Sea coastal habitats.

Natural climate variability, particularly the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), strongly influences both phytoplankton and zooplankton diversity in the Bay of Biscay and Iberian Coast. Decreasing AMO values (cooler conditions) represent the most important variable affecting phytoplankton and zooplankton in oceanic habitats and zooplankton in shelf habitats. However, AMO relationships with plankton diversity vary regionally, making these connections difficult to characterize consistently.

Quality status assessments incorporate climate change impacts alongside anthropogenic pressures. Indicators showing declining states or changes linked to increasing climate change impacts receive ""Not good"" status classifications. Climate change and eutrophication appear jointly responsible for community composition changes in coastal and shelf habitats.

Long-term plankton assemblages react to climate change and large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns like the North Atlantic Oscillation, requiring assessment across multiple temporal and spatial scales. Plankton communities respond non-linearly to anthropogenic pressures, making clear state-pressure relationships difficult to identify.

In the Bay of Biscay and Iberian Coast, increasing sea surface temperature (SST) is directly linked to downward trends in zooplankton communities toward atypical composition. Climate change and eutrophication are identified as jointly responsible for changes in community composition in both coastal and shelf habitats of this region, resulting in ""Not good"" quality status.

In the Greater North Sea coastal habitats, climate change manifests through changing wind patterns and sinking mixed layer depth, driving zooplankton communities toward atypical compositions as wind speed increases. Natural climate variability, particularly the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), strongly influences both phytoplankton and zooplankton diversity across oceanic and shelf habitats, with decreasing AMO (cooler conditions) being the most important factor in the Bay of Biscay and Iberian Coast.

Plankton assemblages respond to climate change impacts at multiple temporal scales, from short-term meteorological events to long-term atmospheric circulation pattern changes like the North Atlantic Oscillation. The assessment framework explicitly incorporates climate change impacts when determining quality status, with indicators classified as ""Not good"" when linked to increasing anthropogenic pressures including climate change.

Climate change acts alongside other human-induced disturbances including greenhouse gas emissions, with plankton species responding differently to these changing environmental conditions. The complex interactions between climate variables, ocean chemistry changes, and plankton community dynamics require continued monitoring to understand future trajectory patterns, as relationships between climate pressures and plankton indicators vary by location within OSPAR regions.",,"Climate change significantly impacts marine plankton communities, which form the foundation of marine food webs by linking phytoplankton to fish and transferring energy to higher trophic levels. Plankton species composition and abundance are continuously influenced by changes in physical, chemical, and climatic conditions, causing community composition to fluctuate over very short time scales.

Several climate-related mechanisms drive these changes. Increasing sea surface temperatures linked to downward trends in zooplankton communities toward atypical compositions. Sinking mixed layer depths, potentially caused by climate change, correlate with decreased zooplankton ecological quality ratios toward atypical community composition in variable salinity habitats. Increasing wind speeds, possibly climate-related, drive zooplankton communities toward atypical compositions in coastal Greater North Sea habitats.

Natural climate variability strongly influences plankton diversity. Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation serves as a major driver for both phytoplankton and zooplankton in oceanic and shelf habitats, with decreasing AMO (cooler conditions) being particularly important. North Atlantic Oscillation also affects plankton assemblages through large-scale atmospheric circulation pattern changes.

Climate change interacts with other pressures including eutrophication to alter community composition. Unbalanced nitrogen-to-phosphate ratios alter trophic states of pelagic habitats, while increasing nitrate concentrations contribute to less typical phytoplankton community compositions. Ocean acidification, reflected in decreasing pH, correlates with downward trends toward atypical phytoplankton compositions in Celtic Seas coastal habitats.

These changes result in habitat quality status classifications of ""Not good"" across multiple regions, indicating that sustained climate-driven changes in plankton diversity can alter marine ecosystem functioning and impact ecosystem services.",,"The OSPAR report identifies several significant gaps in understanding and monitoring climate change impacts on plankton diversity. A primary gap exists in distinguishing between natural climate variability and anthropogenic climate change effects. While plankton communities respond to large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns like the North Atlantic Oscillation and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, the relationship varies by region and remains ""unknown"" for many areas.

Spatial and temporal monitoring coverage presents substantial gaps. Coastal and variable salinity habitats within the Greater North Sea, Celtic Seas, and Bay of Biscay were not assessed despite existing long-term datasets due to limited temporal coverage, inconsistent sampling effort, and incomplete community accounting. Better acquisition of region-wide plankton data is required, particularly for offshore stations in variable salinity and coastal habitats.

The report reveals methodological gaps in linking climate pressures to community changes. Plankton communities do not respond linearly to anthropogenic pressures, making clear state-pressure relationships difficult to identify. While increasing sea surface temperature was linked to downward trends in zooplankton communities in coastal habitats, and wind speed increases (potentially climate-related) correlated with atypical zooplankton composition, these relationships require further investigation.

Technical gaps include the need to develop spatial and temporal confidence measures for results, consistent winter monitoring (as winter typically shows high species richness), and integration of the Hill concept to factor sampling effort into indicator calculations. The report notes that combining multiple monitoring methods could help fill gaps in microscopic examinations. Despite evidence that climate change and eutrophication may be responsible for community composition changes in coastal and shelf habitats, definitive causal relationships remain poorly understood.",,"Based on the OSPAR report findings, several key climate change recommendations emerge from the plankton diversity assessment, along with specific research gaps requiring investigation.

The report identifies climate change as a major driver affecting plankton communities across the North-East Atlantic. Increasing sea surface temperatures are directly linked to downward trends in zooplankton communities, while changes in wind speed patterns and sinking mixed layer depths - both potentially climate-related - are causing shifts toward atypical community compositions in coastal habitats. Natural climate variability, including the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, strongly influences both phytoplankton and zooplankton diversity patterns, particularly in the Bay of Biscay and Iberian Coast regions.

Critical research needs include quantifying phytoplankton's contribution to pH variability, as current understanding of the relationship between pH changes and phytoplankton diversity remains incomplete. Further investigation is required to establish clear connections between climate pressures and the observed shifts in plankton community composition, though this work is resource-dependent.

The report emphasizes the importance of considering plankton assemblages at multiple temporal and spatial scales, given their responses to both large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns and local climate effects. Future assessments require improved spatial and temporal confidence measures to better target monitoring efforts in regions experiencing climate-driven changes.

Continued monitoring of both phytoplankton and zooplankton components is essential to confirm whether current trend trajectories will persist, particularly as relationships between climate pressures and diversity indicators vary by location. The integration of climate change impacts with eutrophication effects requires better understanding, as both factors appear responsible for observed community composition changes across coastal and shelf habitats.",,"In the OSPAR Maritime Area, ocean acidification manifests as decreasing pH levels that correlate with significant changes in marine plankton communities. In coastal habitats of the Celtic Seas, decreasing pH was highly positively correlated with phytoplankton diversity and correlated with a downward trend towards an atypical composition of phytoplankton communities.

However, this relationship between pH and phytoplankton diversity requires cautious interpretation because phytoplankton directly impact pH through the ingestion of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) to fuel growth and reproduction. Further analysis is necessary to quantify phytoplankton's contribution to pH variability, indicating a complex feedback loop between biological processes and ocean chemistry.

The pH data utilized in the assessment comes from the European Regional Seas Ecosystem Model (ERSEM) and is reported on the total scale. Ocean acidification appears alongside climate change as a pressure that plankton assemblages react to over long-term periods, with plankton species composition and abundance continuously influenced by changes in physical, chemical, and climatic conditions.

The assessment reveals that relationships between environmental pressures, including pH changes, and plankton indicators vary by location across OSPAR regions. Natural climate variability, particularly the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation, was identified as a strong link for both phytoplankton and zooplankton communities in some regions, while pH decrease specifically affected coastal Celtic Seas habitats.

The findings suggest that ocean acidification is an ongoing pressure affecting marine ecosystem functioning, particularly through alterations in plankton community composition, though the full extent of these impacts requires further investigation to separate cause-and-effect relationships from natural biological feedback mechanisms.",,"Ocean acidification impacts species, habitats and ecosystems primarily through effects on plankton communities, which form the foundation of marine food webs. In coastal habitats of the Celtic Seas, decreasing pH was correlated with a downward trend towards atypical composition of phytoplankton communities during 2015-2019. This relationship requires cautious interpretation since phytoplankton directly impact pH through ingestion of dissolved inorganic carbon to fuel growth and reproduction.

The ecological consequences extend beyond individual species to ecosystem functioning. Phytoplankton are extremely diverse, ranging from photosynthesizing cyanobacteria to plant-like green micro-algae, silicon-armoured diatoms, flagella-driven dinoflagellates, and calcite-plated coccolithophores. Zooplankton, equally diverse, play a major role in marine food webs by linking phytoplankton to fish and facilitating energy transfer to higher trophic levels.

Changes in plankton diversity can alter marine ecosystem functioning and impact the regulating, provisioning and cultural services ecosystems provide to humans. Both phytoplankton and zooplankton species composition and abundance are continuously influenced by changes in physical, chemical, and climatic conditions, with community composition fluctuating over very short time scales.

Natural and human-induced pressures drive changes in community composition, causing plankton community dynamics and structural attributes to differ from natural undisturbed communities. The quality status of coastal habitats was determined ""Not good"" for phytoplankton in affected areas. However, further analysis is necessary to quantify phytoplankton's contribution to pH variability and fully understand these ecosystem-level impacts.",,9,1,12

Fishing-related debris comprises four to five of the top ten items in each region. Marine animals can ingest or become entangled in this litter, resulting in death or injury, while plastic items serve as potential contaminant sources and can cause habitat damage or transport invasive species.

The only climate change-related information present is a brief reference to climate change and ocean acidification as challenges requiring resilience, but no specific impacts on species, habitats, or ecosystems are documented.

The context does provide relevant information about other environmental impacts on marine life: marine animals can ingest or become entangled in seafloor litter, resulting in death or injury. Plastic items serve as potential sources of contaminants through chemical additives and can cause habitat damage or act as transport vectors for invasive species. Large amounts of plastic litter have been documented on the European continental shelf, with plastic and fishing-related debris being the dominant litter categories found.

The assessment identified significant knowledge gaps regarding litter transport mechanisms, the relationship between hydrodynamics, geomorphology and human factors in determining seafloor litter distribution, and the need for better understanding of how commercial trawling intensities affect litter distribution and amounts. However, these findings relate to marine litter impacts rather than climate change effects on marine ecosystems.",,"The OSPAR report identifies several knowledge gaps related to climate change, though the assessment focuses primarily on seafloor litter monitoring rather than climate impacts directly.

The primary climate-related gap concerns the lack of assessment capability in Arctic Waters, where no data was available despite this region being particularly vulnerable to climate change effects. Additionally, insufficient data coverage in the Wider Atlantic region (only 111 locations with inadequate coverage) prevents comprehensive assessment in another climatically important area.

Temporal analysis gaps significantly limit understanding of climate-related trends. The assessment relies on very short data series, with meaningful temporal comparisons possible only for 2015-2019 in some regions, making trend detection difficult. Power analysis is needed to determine what magnitude of trends can be detected with current monitoring approaches. For the Greater North Sea case study (2015-2020), no clear temporal trend was established, though this was attributed to the insufficient number of years rather than absence of trends.

Methodological gaps compound climate-related monitoring challenges. Current trawl surveys capture only approximately 5% of seafloor items, with spatial coverage limited to soft sediment areas where bottom trawling occurs, excluding rocky substrates and reefs. Gear type differences introduce uncertainty when establishing temporal trends across different survey methods.

Data quality issues create additional barriers to climate trend analysis. Inconsistent counting methodologies among contracting parties, insufficient technical guidelines, and lack of quality control prevent reliable trend detection across OSPAR regions. Only UK survey data met criteria for count analysis due to harmonized methodology.

Future assessments require expanded monitoring approaches beyond opportunistic surveys, standardized methodologies, and extended time series to adequately detect climate-related changes in marine litter distribution and abundance patterns.",,"Based on the provided context, this OSPAR report does not contain specific recommendations related to climate change.

All indicator assessments,Concentration of chlorophyll-a,OK,p00928_qsr2023_chlorophylla,"Climate change is identified as a complicating factor in marine eutrophication assessments within the OSPAR Maritime Area. The report states that cumulative effects, including climate change, may have similar effects on biological communities and dissolved oxygen as nutrient enrichment, making it more difficult to establish causal links between nutrient inputs and observed ecological disturbances.

Climate change impacts marine ecosystems through effects on biological communities and oxygen levels, potentially mimicking or amplifying the symptoms of eutrophication. This creates analytical challenges when trying to isolate the specific effects of nutrient pollution from other environmental pressures.

The assessment methodology acknowledges that phytoplankton biomass production is determined not only by nutrient concentrations but also by light and temperature conditions. Temperature changes associated with climate change therefore directly influence chlorophyll concentrations, which serve as proxies for phytoplankton biomass in these assessments.

Physical factors affected by climate change, including vertical and horizontal mixing patterns and stratification, impact phytoplankton growth, mortality and transport processes. These climate-related changes in ocean physics alter the baseline conditions against which eutrophication effects are measured.

The report notes that in the Kattegat region, there has been a tendency toward increasing chlorophyll concentrations over approximately the last ten years, following both higher nitrogen inputs from land and increasing winter concentrations of inorganic nitrogen, though it does not explicitly attribute this trend to climate change.

The complexity introduced by climate change effects necessitates more sophisticated assessment approaches that can distinguish between climate-driven changes and those caused by nutrient enrichment, representing an ongoing challenge for marine environmental monitoring and management.",,"Climate change represents a significant complicating factor in marine ecosystem assessment and management. The analysis reveals that climate change generates cumulative effects that produce impacts similar to those caused by nutrient enrichment, specifically affecting biological communities and dissolved oxygen levels in marine environments.

This similarity in effects creates substantial analytical challenges. When marine ecosystems experience disturbances such as habitat and biodiversity changes, nuisance algae blooms, decreased water clarity, and behavioral changes or death in fish and other species, identifying whether these impacts result from nutrient enrichment or climate change becomes extremely difficult. The overlapping nature of these effects further complicates efforts to demonstrate clear causal links between specific pressures and observed ecosystem disturbances.

The assessment methodology acknowledges these complications by recognizing that multiple pressures operate simultaneously in marine environments. Chlorophyll concentrations, used as indicators of ecosystem health, respond to various environmental factors including light and temperature - both of which are directly influenced by climate change. Physical factors such as vertical and horizontal mixing, stratification, and temperature affect phytoplankton growth, mortality, and transport processes.

The complexity extends beyond simple cause-and-effect relationships. Climate change interacts with other stressors in ways that can amplify or modify ecosystem responses, making it challenging to isolate the specific contribution of any single pressure. This understanding has direct implications for management strategies, as addressing eutrophication or other marine issues requires accounting for the concurrent effects of climate change on the same biological processes and ecosystem components.",,"Climate change acts as a cumulative pressure that significantly complicates the understanding of marine ecosystem impacts. Climate change produces similar effects on biological communities and dissolved oxygen as nutrient enrichment, making it difficult to establish causal links between environmental disturbances and their specific drivers.

The impacts manifest through multiple interconnected pathways. Climate change contributes to shifts in the composition and extent of flora and fauna, oxygen depletion due to biomass decomposition, changes in habitats and biodiversity, blooms of nuisance algae or macroalgae, decreased water clarity, and behavioral changes or death of fish and other species. These effects mirror those caused by eutrophication, creating complex cumulative impacts.

Phytoplankton communities are particularly affected through climate-mediated changes in fundamental processes. Production of phytoplankton biomass depends not only on nutrient concentrations but also on light and temperature conditions. Physical factors including turbidity, depth, vertical and horizontal mixing, and stratification influence growth, mortality and transport processes. Biological factors such as algal species composition, zooplankton grazing patterns, and competition with other primary producers are also affected.

These climate-driven changes create system-specific responses that vary spatially and temporally. The ratio of carbon to chlorophyll in phytoplankton cells varies systematically with environmental conditions, including those modified by climate change. Temperature and light conditions directly influence chlorophyll concentrations observed at monitoring sites through their effects on growth, mortality and transport processes.

The complex interactions between climate change and other pressures result in unpredictable ecosystem responses, where reduction in one pressure may not produce expected improvements due to ongoing climate-driven changes affecting the same biological processes and community structures.",,"The provided context identifies several gaps related to climate change impacts on marine eutrophication assessment. Climate change creates cumulative effects that produce similar impacts on biological communities and dissolved oxygen as nutrient enrichment, significantly complicating efforts to demonstrate causal links between eutrophication disturbances and nutrient inputs. This confounding effect represents a fundamental analytical challenge where multiple pressures interact to obscure direct cause-effect relationships.

The assessment framework faces methodological gaps in handling climate-related complications. The approach to derive thresholds from reference conditions requires further elaboration to better reflect differences in responses of assessment parameters and spatial gradients in anthropogenic pressures - factors that climate change influences. Current threshold derivation methods do not adequately account for how climate variability affects baseline conditions and parameter responses.

Data integration presents another significant gap. The combination of in situ and satellite data needs substantial development, given differences in sampling strategies between countries. Climate change affects the temporal and spatial patterns that these different data sources capture, but no trend analysis combines both datasets due to their different temporal coverage periods. Satellite data availability remains limited, with 40% of surface area excluded from multi-period comparisons due to missing data in Spanish and Portuguese waters.

The response of phytoplankton biomass to nutrient changes is complex and system-specific, with climate factors influencing these relationships. Reduction in nutrient inputs has not always resulted in expected declines in phytoplankton biomass, suggesting climate-driven changes in system responses that current assessment methods cannot fully capture or predict.",,"Based on the provided context, the OSPAR report identifies climate change as a complicating factor in eutrophication assessments and makes several recommendations for addressing climate-related challenges, along with identifying areas requiring further research.

Climate change creates cumulative effects that have similar impacts on biological communities and dissolved oxygen levels as nutrient enrichment, making it difficult to establish causal links between marine disturbances and eutrophication. This complicates efforts to demonstrate direct relationships between nutrient inputs and ecological responses.

The report recommends developing and implementing dynamic validation approaches that combine in situ sampling data with satellite observations over time. This approach should be further developed to address problems with changes in optical properties of phytoplankton over time in relation to nutrient status. The integration opens possibilities for assimilating Earth Observation data into dynamic ecosystem models, enabling future estimates based on both in situ and satellite data interpolated across space and time.

Several areas require further investigation. The approach to combine in situ and satellite data needs further elaboration, particularly given differences in sampling strategies between countries. The methodology for deriving thresholds from reference conditions requires additional development to reflect differences in responses of various assessment parameters and better account for spatial gradients in anthropogenic pressures.

Higher spectral resolution data from Sentinel III satellites, available since 2018, enables more advanced methods for calculating chlorophyll concentrations, potentially eliminating uncertainties in previous assessments. The report emphasizes implementing automated assessment tools by 2022 to deliver harmonized and transparent evaluations for both OSPAR and Marine Strategy Framework Directive requirements, supporting development of coastal eutrophication indices by 2025.",,"Based on the provided context, ocean acidification receives minimal specific coverage in this OSPAR report.

All indicator assessments,Concentrations of winter nutrients,OK,p00927_qsr2023_winter_nutrient_concentrations,"Climate change presents several significant challenges for marine nutrient assessments and eutrophication monitoring in the North-East Atlantic. Climate change produces cumulative effects that have similar impacts on biological communities and dissolved oxygen as nutrient enrichment, thereby complicating efforts to demonstrate causal links between nutrient disturbances and their environmental effects. This overlap in effects makes it difficult to identify whether observed changes in marine ecosystems result from nutrient pollution or climate-related factors.

The impact of climate change on nutrient land-runoff requires detailed investigation, particularly regarding how exceptional weather events should be incorporated into assessment procedures. Floods and droughts during specific periods have led to higher nutrient inputs in individual years, with more pronounced effects on phosphorus compared to nitrogen concentrations. Extreme weather events contribute to increased nutrient loading from terrestrial sources into marine systems.

Changing climate conditions are altering the suitability of traditional assessment approaches. The winter assessment season covering December through February needs re-evaluation due to increasing biological activity during winter months, which may necessitate area-specific adjustments to assessment seasons for future nutrient evaluations. The current methodology of using period means may require modification to account for exceptional years caused by climate-driven floods or droughts, potentially through weighting individual years instead of relying on period averages.

Additionally, Atlantic inflow patterns may contribute to increased nutrient concentrations in certain regions, adding another climate-related variable to nutrient dynamics. These climate-related impacts represent critical knowledge gaps requiring further research to improve the accuracy and relevance of marine eutrophication assessments under changing environmental conditions.",,"Climate change represents a significant complicating factor for marine ecosystem assessment and management in the OSPAR Maritime Area. Cumulative effects, including climate change, produce similar impacts on biological communities and dissolved oxygen as nutrient enrichment, making it extremely difficult to establish causal links between specific disturbances and nutrient pollution. This overlap in effects obscures the ability to diagnose eutrophication accurately.

Climate change is altering fundamental seasonal patterns that affect nutrient assessment methodologies. The traditional winter assessment season (December-February) requires investigation due to changing climate conditions and increasing biological activity during winter months. These changes may necessitate area-specific adjustments to assessment seasons for future nutrient evaluations.

Climate change impacts on nutrient inputs from land require detailed investigation. The effects of exceptional weather events - floods and droughts - on nutrient runoff patterns need better understanding, particularly how these extreme years should be incorporated into assessment calculations. Between 2006 and 2014, extreme weather events and floods led to higher nutrient inputs in individual years, with more pronounced effects on dissolved inorganic phosphorus compared to nitrogen.

The changing climate creates additional challenges for linking nutrient observations with input data. The interaction between climate-driven changes and nutrient dynamics complicates efforts to strengthen connections between area-specific nutrient developments and their sources. Future assessments must account for these climate-driven variations, potentially through weighted approaches that consider exceptional years rather than simple period means in calculation processes.",,"Climate change has significant cumulative effects on marine biological communities and dissolved oxygen levels, similar to the impacts caused by nutrient enrichment. These cumulative effects complicate efforts to establish causal links between environmental disturbances and their drivers.

Climate change is driving increasing biological activity during winter months, particularly affecting the December-February assessment season traditionally used for nutrient monitoring. This changing biological activity pattern may require area-specific adjustments to assessment seasons for future nutrient evaluations.

Climate change directly impacts nutrient land-runoff patterns, requiring detailed investigation of how these changes affect marine ecosystems. Extreme weather events linked to climate change, including floods and droughts, lead to exceptional years with altered nutrient inputs. Floods during 2006-2014 resulted in higher nutrient inputs in individual years, with effects more pronounced for dissolved inorganic phosphate compared to dissolved inorganic nitrogen.

The impacts manifest through shifts in composition and extent of flora and fauna, and oxygen depletion due to decomposition of accumulated biomass. These disturbances cascade into habitat and biodiversity changes, blooms of nuisance algae or macroalgae, decreased water clarity, and reduced fish stocks due to food shortages when benthic animals die. Direct fish kills occur due to low oxygen concentrations.

Changes in nutrient concentrations and ratios, influenced by climate factors, alter phytoplankton community composition. However, significant knowledge gaps remain regarding how exceptional climate years should be incorporated into assessment procedures, and the impact of climate change on nutrient transport patterns requires further investigation to strengthen understanding of climate-ecosystem linkages.",,"Based on the OSPAR report context, several critical knowledge gaps exist in relation to climate change and nutrient assessment. The suitability of the current winter assessment season (December-February) requires investigation due to changing climate and increasing biological activity during winter periods, which may necessitate area-specific adjustments to assessment seasons for future nutrient evaluations.

Climate change impacts on nutrient land-runoff need detailed investigation, particularly regarding how exceptional years caused by floods or droughts should be incorporated into the COMPEAT calculation process. The report suggests implementing weighting of individual years instead of using period means to address climate-driven variability.

Cumulative effects, including climate change, produce similar effects on biological communities and dissolved oxygen as nutrient enrichment, complicating efforts to establish causal links between disturbances and nutrient enrichment pressures. This overlap makes it difficult to isolate specific impacts from eutrophication versus climate change.

Models are required to estimate long-distance transport of nutrients and their regional effects, which remains a knowledge gap listed in the OSPAR Science Agenda. Understanding data variability implications in trend assessments is needed for predicting whether and when nutrient thresholds can be achieved - crucial for nutrient reduction planning and management measures.

Reduced monitoring provides less data over time, and declining monitoring frequency in some areas requires consideration for future assessments. Solutions must be investigated to fill existing and potential future data gaps through additional data sources, including modelled nutrient data, to maintain assessment capability under changing climate conditions.",,"Based on the OSPAR reports, several climate change-related recommendations and research needs are identified:

**Primary Recommendations:**

Climate change impacts on nutrient land-runoff require detailed investigation, particularly how exceptional years due to floods or droughts should be considered in the COMPEAT calculation process. The reports recommend weighing individual years instead of using period means to account for these climate-driven extremes.

The suitability of the current winter assessment season (December, January, February) needs investigation due to changing climate and increasing biological activity during winter months. This may necessitate area-specific adjustments to assessment seasons for future nutrient assessments.

**Research Gaps Requiring Investigation:**

Models are required to estimate long-distance transport of nutrients and their regional effects, which remains a knowledge gap in the OSPAR Science Agenda. Better understanding of data variability implications in trend assessments is needed to predict when thresholds can be achieved, particularly important for determining required nutrient reductions and necessary measures.

The role of estuaries and coastal zones in nutrient removal needs further investigation, especially as estuarine ecosystem states improve under Water Framework Directive efforts.

**Assessment Challenges:**

Cumulative effects, including climate change, may produce similar effects on biological communities and dissolved oxygen as eutrophication, complicating efforts to demonstrate causal links between nutrient enrichment and ecological disturbances. This makes it difficult to distinguish between climate change impacts and nutrient pollution effects.

Solutions must be investigated to fill data gaps through additional data sources, including modelled nutrient data, as declining monitoring frequency reduces available data for assessments under changing climate conditions.",,"The provided context does not contain substantive information about ocean acidification. Ocean acidification is only mentioned twice in organizational vision statements that discuss resilience to ""climate change and ocean acidification,"" but no scientific findings, data, measurements, impacts, or analysis of ocean acidification are presented in this report.

The context discusses only two brief mentions of ocean acidification: it appears in statements about creating an ocean ""resilient to climate change and ocean acidification,"" but no data, findings, or analysis about acidification impacts are provided.

Instead, the document comprehensively addresses eutrophication effects on marine ecosystems. Nutrient enrichment causes shifts in phytoplankton community composition and alters the balance of organisms present in marine waters. These disturbances lead to changes in habitats and biodiversity, including blooms of nuisance algae or macroalgae, decreased water clarity, and reduced fish stocks due to food shortage when benthic animals die from oxygen depletion. Direct fish kills occur due to low oxygen concentrations resulting from decomposition of accumulated biomass.

Elevated nutrient concentrations promote excessive growth of phytoplankton and other plant life. Changes in nutrient concentrations and ratios have documented ecosystem effects, particularly through altering phytoplankton community composition. The depletion of oxygen due to biomass decomposition creates cascading effects throughout marine food webs.

Human activities contributing nutrients include agriculture, combustion processes, municipal and industrial wastewater treatment, and aquaculture. These inputs are higher in coastal waters and decrease seaward through mixing processes. Cumulative effects, including climate change, may have similar effects on biological communities, complicating efforts to demonstrate direct causal links between specific disturbances and nutrient enrichment.",,3,1,5

The document focuses entirely on benthic habitat assessments, monitoring methodologies, and the effects of nutrient and organic enrichment on marine ecosystems in OSPAR regions.

The only reference to climate change appears as a brief organizational statement about creating an ocean ""resilient to climate change and ocean acidification,"" but this provides no scientific findings, data, or analysis about climate change impacts.

The document extensively covers nutrient pollution effects on coastal waters, benthic invertebrates and vegetation communities, Water Framework Directive monitoring programs, and data quality issues. It identifies specific impacted areas in the Kattegat, Norwegian Trench, and Southern Iberian Atlantic, and discusses various pressures including oxygen depletion and hydrological changes. However, these findings are presented in the context of eutrophication and habitat quality assessments rather than climate-related impacts.

The context demonstrates that 0.3% of assessed areas showed poor/bad quality status, with monitoring coverage increasing from 41-45% in 2010 to 58-72% in 2016 across different habitat types. The assessment identifies persistent impacted sectors between 2010 and 2016, but attributes changes to differences in assessed areas and monitoring improvements rather than climate factors.

To answer questions about climate change findings, different sections or reports from OSPAR would be needed that specifically address temperature changes, sea level rise, ocean acidification impacts, or other climate-related marine environmental changes.",,"Based on the provided context, climate change-related threats or pressures receive minimal direct discussion. The only explicit climate change reference mentions the need for marine ecosystems to be ""resilient to climate change and ocean acidification.""

However, several climate change-related pressures are addressed indirectly through their impacts on benthic habitats. Oxygen depletion is identified as a direct pressure affecting benthic habitat communities, with species sensitivity serving as a proxy to quantify this disturbance. Hydrological changes are also recognized as pressures that can directly or indirectly affect benthic communities through modifications to species composition and community structure.

The context reveals that current monitoring and assessment methods have significant limitations regarding climate-related pressures. Existing benthic indices and statistical methods were primarily developed and calibrated to assess nutrient and organic enrichment from land-based sources. The Marine Strategy Framework Directive requires adaptation of monitoring systems to consider and assess other pressure types beyond nutrient enrichment, but these indices are not directly calibrated for climate-related impacts.

A critical gap exists in assessing cumulative effects of multiple pressures. The condition of benthic habitats reflects combined effects of all pressures, yet current methods focus predominantly on nutrient enrichment rather than climate-related stressors. Development of methods to assess ""other pressure types"" and ultimately cumulative pressure effects is identified as necessary for improving interpretation of results and guiding response measures.

The assessment acknowledges that pressure-impact relationships need better understanding at community levels, particularly regarding sensitivity to different pressure gradients, which would be relevant for climate change impacts.",,"The provided context focuses on nutrient and organic enrichment impacts on coastal benthic habitats rather than climate change impacts. However, it reveals several mechanisms by which environmental stressors affect marine ecosystems that may be relevant to understanding broader environmental pressures.

Nutrient and organic enrichment cause nuisance and toxic algal blooms, loss of benthic vegetation due to shading, and modification of benthic fauna communities due to specific sensitivities. Benthic habitats experience oxygen depletion and hydrological changes as secondary effects, with entire benthic communities exposed when pressures occur due to their limited mobility compared to fish or marine mammals.

Species respond differently based on their sensitivity classifications as sensitive, tolerant, or opportunistic species. Community structure deviates from reference conditions through multi-dimensional changes, with impacts assessed through diversity indices, species richness, and proportions of different sensitivity groups. The condition of benthic habitats reflects combined effects of all pressures to which they are subjected.

Between 2010 and 2016, benthic invertebrates showed improved status with ""High/Good"" quality increasing from 34.8% to 57.1%, though ""Moderate"" status also increased from 6.63% to 15.2%. Main impacted areas persisted in the Kattegat and Southern North Sea, with some newly impacted areas emerging.

The assessment methodology requires understanding natural spatial and temporal variation scales and sensitivity to specific pressure gradients. Analysis occurs at community level rather than species level, combining biological and pressure data to calibrate pressure-impact relationships and assess disturbance levels and resilience.

The context does not specifically address climate change impacts, limiting a comprehensive answer to that question.",,"The provided context does not contain any specific discussion about gaps in relation to climate change. The document focuses entirely on benthic habitat assessments related to nutrient and organic enrichment, with no mention of climate change impacts, climate-related monitoring gaps, or climate adaptation needs.

The gaps discussed in the context are related to marine monitoring and assessment methodology, specifically: data coverage gaps exist in several areas for most assessment units, with no information available about the reasons for these gaps or their potential bias on results. Finer-scale networks for state-pressure relationship assessments are heterogeneous and require further investigation. Countries store monitoring data using common methodology, but improvements are needed to achieve coherence and data availability. Heterogeneities between indicators and assessment methods limit inter-calibration and comparison of results at wider regional and European scales.

The document identifies the need for coordinated or joint monitoring to ensure cost-efficiency, coherence and robustness at sub-regional scales. Data for the 2016-2021 reporting cycle were unavailable from any Contracting Party at the time of assessment. The assessment methodology shows moderate confidence due to intercalibration issues and different indices with varying sensitivity to different pressure types.

The knowledge gaps specifically relate to developing methods, monitoring and data flow to assess other pressure types beyond nutrient enrichment, and ultimately assessing cumulative effects of pressures. However, none of these identified gaps specifically address climate change considerations, impacts, or related monitoring needs.",,"The provided context does not contain specific recommendations related to climate change. The document focuses exclusively on the assessment of benthic habitat communities in relation to nutrient and organic enrichment, with no discussion of climate change impacts, adaptation measures, or climate-related research needs.

The context reveals that current monitoring systems primarily assess nutrient and organic enrichment pressures using indices developed specifically for these stressors. The Marine Strategy Framework Directive requires reconsideration and adaptation of monitoring to assess other pressure types both inshore and offshore, but these are not specifically identified as climate-related pressures.

Key research gaps identified include: finer-scale networks of state-pressure relationship assessment areas require further investigation; development of methods to assess other pressure types beyond nutrient enrichment; assessment of cumulative effects of multiple pressures; coordinated or joint monitoring programs to ensure coherence at sub-regional scales; and smaller scale investigations between or within water bodies to refine spatial distribution of quality status and pressure sources.

The assessment covers coastal waters in the Greater North Sea, Celtic Seas, and Bay of Biscay and Iberian Coast regions, using Water Framework Directive monitoring data. Results show that benthic invertebrates with ""High/Good"" quality status increased from 34.8% to 57.1% between assessment periods, while main impacted areas persist in the Kattegat, Norwegian Trench, Southern North Sea, and Southern Iberian Atlantic.

However, beyond brief mentions that the North-East Atlantic should be ""resilient to climate change and ocean acidification,"" the context provides no information about ocean acidification's specific impacts on marine species, habitats, or ecosystems. The assessment methods described focus on species sensitivity to nutrient enrichment, oxygen depletion, and hydrological changes, but do not include ocean acidification as an assessed pressure type. The context acknowledges that current monitoring indices are primarily calibrated for nutrient and organic enrichment, with requirements to develop methods for assessing other pressure types, but ocean acidification impacts are not detailed.",,1,1,2
All indicator assessments,Condition of benthic habitat community Margalef diversity in Region II (Greater North Sea),OK,p00947_bh2b_nethic_habitat_margalef_diversity_qsr2023,"Based on the provided context, climate change receives limited direct discussion in this OSPAR report on benthic habitat conditions. The primary climate change reference appears in relation to observed changes in the Kattegat region.

Specifically, the report identifies decreasing relative diversity in various infralittoral and circalittoral habitats in the Kattegat, alongside changes in inflow from the Baltic Sea beyond increased fisheries pressures. The analysis raises a critical question about whether observed patterns of salinity variability are recurrent with expected community recovery in coming years, or whether salinity variability is increasing and extending over larger areas in connection with climate change.

The report documents significant decreases in relative diversity in the offshore circalittoral zone of the Kattegat for mixed sediment habitat in Swedish waters and muddy habitat in Danish waters. Natural variability in low salinity water outflow from the Baltic Sea creates naturally disturbed communities and larger year-to-year variability in local benthic diversity, particularly in infralittoral and circalittoral habitats where salinity variability represents a common process.

Additionally, the report's concluding vision statement acknowledges the need for marine ecosystems to be ""resilient to climate change and ocean acidification,"" though this appears as an aspirational goal rather than a detailed scientific finding.

The context primarily focuses on immediate pressures like fishing activities, eutrophication, and pollution rather than comprehensive climate change impacts. The climate change discussion remains limited to specific regional observations of changing salinity patterns and their potential long-term implications for benthic community recovery in the Baltic Sea-influenced Kattegat region.",,"Salinity variability in the Kattegat region is increasing and extending over larger areas, potentially related to climate change, alongside changes in inflow from the Baltic Sea. This variability results in naturally disturbed benthic communities and larger year-to-year variability in local benthic diversity. The critical uncertainty is whether these salinity patterns are recurrent events allowing community recovery in coming years, or represent a sustained climate-related trend.

In the offshore circalittoral zone of the Kattegat, significant decreases in relative diversity have been observed in both Swedish mixed sediment habitats and Danish muddy habitats. Natural variability in low salinity water outflow from the Baltic Sea creates disturbed communities, with decreasing trends in relative diversity documented for circalittoral muddy habitats in the Kattegat and Norwegian Trench.

Beyond salinity changes, climate-related pressures include ocean acidification effects on benthic ecosystems. Multiple interacting pressures affect habitat quality, including changes in salinity conditions, hydrodynamic conditions, increased turbidity, anoxic regions, and impacts from nutrients and pollutants. The Relative Margalef diversity index shows consistent decline across pollution and eutrophication gradients, indicating these pressures may overrule physical disturbance impacts in combined-pressure situations.

The possible extension of anoxic areas represents a relevant development requiring monitoring. Current assessments focus primarily on fishing pressure as the dominant impact, but clearer examples exist of other pressures including changes in salinity and hydrodynamic conditions that influence benthic habitat quality.

Future work requires comprehensive pressure mapping covering the entire range of potential climate-related and other pressure combinations, with risk-based assessments incorporating pressure distributions and habitat sensitivity to support ecosystem resilience against climate change impacts.",,"Based on the provided context, climate change impacts on species, habitats and ecosystems are primarily identified through salinity changes and their cascading effects on benthic communities. In the Kattegat region, salinity variability is increasing and extending over larger areas, potentially related to climate change. This variability in low salinity water outflow from the Baltic Sea results in naturally disturbed communities and larger year-to-year variability in local benthic diversity.

A significant decrease in relative diversity is observed in the offshore circalittoral zone of the Kattegat, particularly for mixed sediment habitat in the Swedish part and muddy habitat in the Danish part. The critical question remains whether observed patterns are recurrent with expected community recovery, or whether salinity variability represents a persistent climate change impact preventing ecosystem restoration.

In infralittoral and circalittoral habitats of the Kattegat, natural salinity variations create disturbed communities. Where salinity variability is common, communities are likely adapted to these conditions, but expanding variability may exceed adaptive capacity. The natural disturbance from changing salinity conditions affects species diversity patterns across different habitat types.

However, the context reveals significant limitations in distinguishing climate change impacts from other pressures. Multiple stressors including eutrophication, diffuse pollution, physical disturbance from fisheries, and naturally occurring anoxic conditions simultaneously affect benthic habitats. Changes in inflow patterns from the Baltic could involve both natural variability and climate-driven alterations, but the assessment lacks sufficient data to definitively separate these influences.

The available information focuses primarily on one regional example and does not provide comprehensive analysis of broader climate change impacts across species, habitats, and ecosystems in the marine environment.",,"Based on the provided OSPAR report context, several key gaps related to climate change are identified in marine benthic habitat assessments.

The most direct climate change-related gap concerns salinity variability in the Kattegat region. Scientists question whether observed salinity patterns are temporary disturbances from which communities will recover, or whether salinity variability is increasing and extending over larger areas in connection with climate change. This uncertainty affects the interpretation of significant decreases in relative diversity observed in Swedish mixed sediment habitats and Danish muddy habitats in the offshore circalittoral zone.

Critical knowledge gaps exist regarding pressure mapping and integration. The current assessment focuses almost entirely on physical disturbance from fisheries as the dominant pressure, but fails to adequately incorporate other climate-related pressures. There is insufficient understanding of how the Relative Margalef diversity index responds to different pressures and whether one pressure impact might override others. The assessment lacks comprehensive pressure mapping that would integrate potential impacts of multiple pressures, including those related to climate change.

Environmental gradient integration represents another significant gap. The report identifies the need to understand how to integrate important environmental gradients that impact diversity when estimating reference values. This includes determining what reference value gradients based on environmental gradients mean for comparability of assessment results between different areas.

Additional gaps include inadequate consideration of changes in salinity conditions, hydrodynamic conditions, and the broader effects of nutrient and pollution interactions that may be influenced by climate variability. The assessment methodology currently cannot distinguish between natural climate-driven changes and anthropogenic impacts, limiting the ability to predict future ecosystem responses to climate change.",,"Based on the provided context, the report makes limited specific recommendations regarding climate change, but identifies several areas requiring investigation. The most direct climate change reference appears when discussing observed decreasing trends in relative diversity in the Kattegat, where the analysis questions ""whether salinity variability is increasing and extending over larger areas and might be related to climate change.""

The report emphasizes the need for expanded pressure mapping beyond the current focus on fisheries impacts. Currently, assessments concentrate almost entirely on physical disturbance by fisheries as the dominant pressure, but the analysis reveals that benthic habitat quality can be influenced by various other pressures including anoxic regions, impacts from nutrients and pollutants, increased turbidity, and changes in salinity conditions and hydrodynamic conditions.

Key research gaps identified include investigating to what extent the Relative Margalef diversity responds to each type of pressure and whether one pressure impact might overrule others. The analysis notes that while natural disturbances like variation in low salinity water inflow from the Baltic might play significant roles, these factors require better integration into assessment frameworks.

Future work recommendations focus on developing an indicator framework covering the entire range of potential pressures and pressure combinations, with combined pressure mapping and risk-based assessments taking pressure distributions and specific pressure sensitivity into account. The report specifically calls for more efforts in pressure mapping and integrating potential impacts of various pressures in assessment results.

The context suggests that monitoring the possible extension of anoxic areas represents a relevant development requiring attention, particularly as eutrophication effects and impacts from diffuse pollution may prevent benthic habitats from recovering even when fishing pressures decrease.",,"The provided context contains no substantive information about ocean acidification. Ocean acidification is mentioned only twice in the document - both instances appear in identical organizational vision statements on pages 28 that reference ""resilience to climate change and ocean acidification"" as a goal for the North-East Atlantic Ocean.

The OSPAR report focuses entirely on benthic habitat communities and their condition in the Greater North Sea region, examining factors such as physical disturbance from fisheries, eutrophication, diffuse pollution, nutrient enrichment, sedimentation, and contaminants. While the report extensively discusses various pressures affecting marine benthic habitats, including naturally occurring anoxic circumstances that result in absence of benthic species and lower diversity, it provides no data, findings, analysis, or discussion specifically about ocean acidification as a pressure or impact factor.

The document examines benthic community diversity using the Margalef diversity index across different habitat types and assessment periods (1998-2008, 2009-2015, and 2016-2021), but ocean acidification is not identified among the pressures analyzed or considered in the assessment methodology. The report calls for more comprehensive pressure mapping and indicates that future work should focus on indicator frameworks covering the entire range of potential pressures, but ocean acidification is not specifically mentioned in this context either.",,"The provided context does not contain specific information about ocean acidification impacts on species, habitats and ecosystems. While ocean acidification is mentioned twice in the context as part of organizational vision statements about creating resilience to ""climate change and ocean acidification,"" no substantive scientific findings, data, or analysis regarding acidification effects are presented.

The context focuses extensively on benthic habitat assessments in the North-East Atlantic, examining how physical disturbance from fisheries, eutrophication, nutrient enrichment, sedimentation, contaminants, and diffuse pollution affect seafloor communities. The analysis uses Margalef diversity indices to measure benthic habitat quality across different zones (infralittoral, circalittoral, and offshore circalittoral) and habitat types.

Key findings show that benthic communities suffer reduced diversity when exposed to multiple pressures. Sensitive species are lost even at low disturbance frequencies, and recovery can be prevented by recurrent low-level disturbances. Eutrophication causes anoxic conditions that eliminate benthic species entirely. Different habitat types show varying sensitivity to these pressures, with infralittoral habitats generally in poorer condition than offshore areas.

However, none of these impacts are attributed to ocean acidification specifically. The assessment methodology acknowledges that benthic habitat condition ""reflects the combined effect of all the pressures put upon them,"" but acidification is not identified among the pressures analyzed (physical disturbance, nutrient enrichment, sedimentation, contaminants). To answer the question about ocean acidification impacts, additional context containing specific acidification research would be required.",,3,1,5

The document does identify several environmental pressures that may be climate-related, though it does not explicitly connect them to climate change. These include hydrological changes, oxygen depletion, and changes in water characteristics - all of which are assessed as pressures affecting benthic habitat communities. Hydrological changes are specifically mentioned as having direct and indirect effects on benthic communities, and species sensitivity to hydrological changes is used as a proxy to quantify disturbance in habitat assessments.

The assessment framework described evaluates environmental data including ""substrate and water characteristics"" and examines ""natural spatial and temporal scales of variation"" in marine communities, which could potentially capture climate-related changes, but this connection is not explicitly made in the provided text.

While climate change is mentioned once in passing as something the North-East Atlantic Ocean should be ""resilient to"" alongside ocean acidification, no detailed analysis of climate change pressures is presented.

The context focuses primarily on benthic habitat assessment methodologies and identifies several pressure types affecting marine benthic communities, including physical damage, removal of species, hydrological changes, eutrophication from nutrients or organic matter, non-indigenous species, and contaminants. These pressures cause disturbance to benthic habitat communities through direct or indirect effects such as nutrient and organic enrichment, oxygen depletion, sand extraction, and hydrological changes.

The assessment framework described evaluates how benthic communities respond to various pressure gradients by measuring deviations in species composition from reference conditions. Species sensitivity serves as a proxy to quantify disturbance, with multi-metric benthic indices incorporating diversity indices, species richness, and proportions of sensitive, tolerant, and opportunistic species.

However, none of these pressure types are explicitly linked to climate change impacts in the provided text. The cumulative effects of co-occurring pressures are acknowledged as not currently assessed, and further development is needed to understand how multiple pressure types interact.

Instead, the context focuses exclusively on benthic habitat assessment methodologies and various human-induced pressures affecting marine benthic communities.

The context identifies several pressure types affecting benthic habitats, including physical damage, species removal, hydrological changes, eutrophication from nutrients or organic matter, non-indigenous species introduction, and contaminants. Benthic habitats are particularly vulnerable because they are characterized by animal and plant communities with limited or no mobility compared to fish or marine mammals, meaning entire benthic communities become exposed when pressures occur. The quality status of benthic habitats reflects combined effects of all pressures to which they are subjected.

Species sensitivity serves as a proxy to quantify disturbance from pressures such as nutrient and organic enrichment, oxygen depletion, sand extraction, or hydrological changes. Assessment methods use diversity indices, species richness indices, and proportions of sensitive, tolerant, and opportunistic species to evaluate habitat condition. Impact detection occurs by measuring deviation from reference stations defined as under least-damage conditions.

Currently, only two condition-versus-pressure interactions have sufficiently developed methodologies: coastal habitat assessments related to nutrient and organic enrichment. Cumulative effects of co-occurring pressures are not currently assessed.

However, this organizational vision statement does not provide substantive information about climate change-related gaps.

The gaps identified in the document relate to benthic habitat assessment capabilities. Many knowledge gaps exist in understanding benthic habitats, particularly regarding habitat community and sensitivity classification for several habitat types and the characteristics of different pressure types including physical, contaminants and biological pressures. The cumulative effect of co-occurring pressures at the same place and time range is not currently assessed. Only two conditions versus pressure interactions have sufficiently developed methodologies and data availability for assessment.

While ocean acidification is mentioned twice as a concern for marine resilience, the document focuses entirely on benthic habitat assessment methodologies and pressures other than acidification.

The context addresses impacts on benthic habitats from various pressures including physical damage, nutrient enrichment, organic enrichment, oxygen depletion, sand extraction, and hydrological changes. Benthic habitats are essential for marine life because marine species rely directly or indirectly on the seafloor to feed, hide, rest or reproduce. These habitats are characterized by animal and plant communities with no or slow mobility compared to fish or marine mammals, making the whole benthic community exposed when pressures occur.

The condition of benthic habitats reflects the combined effects of all pressures to which they are subject. Species sensitivity serves as a proxy to quantify disturbance effects, with assessments using diversity indices, species richness indices, and proportions of sensitive, tolerant and opportunistic species. The technical principle involves detecting and quantifying pressure impacts through deviations compared to reference stations under least-damage conditions.

However, significant knowledge gaps exist in benthic habitat community and sensitivity classification for several habitat types and the characteristics of various pressure types including physical, contaminants and biological pressures.

The context primarily focuses on physical disturbance to benthic habitats from aggregate extraction activities rather than climate change impacts. The document extensively analyzes habitat sensitivity, extraction pressures, and disturbance assessments across various OSPAR assessment units from 2009-2020, but does not examine climate-related pressures or impacts.

The methodology described assesses habitat resilience and resistance to extraction pressures, with resilience defined as ""ability of a habitat to recover"" from disturbance. However, this resilience assessment is specifically related to physical extraction activities rather than climate change stressors.

The context mentions that understanding of ecosystem changes in response to physical disturbance could be improved through greater availability of reference data from unimpacted areas, but this relates to extraction impacts rather than climate effects.

The document does discuss various pressures and threats to marine benthic habitats and ecosystems, but these are primarily physical disturbances from human activities, specifically aggregate extraction. Key pressures identified include physical disturbance to the seabed from extraction activities, which can have deleterious effects on benthic organisms and habitats. The assessment examines habitat structure changes through removal of substratum, sediment resuspension, siltation, smothering, and sedimentation changes as secondary impacts.

Knowledge gaps remain in understanding biological responses to adverse effects caused by extraction pressure and other physical disturbance pressures.

Species and habitat sensitivities are evaluated using the EUNIS classification system, with sensitivity assessments derived from MarESA (Marine Evidence-based Sensitivity Assessments). The assessment covers various benthic habitat types including rock habitats, sediment habitats, and biogenic reefs like Sabellaria spinulosa.

Key findings relate to extraction impacts: disturbance occurred in 13 Broad Habitat Types, with little annual variation observed across assessment units except in the Channel and Kattegat regions. The assessment reveals knowledge gaps regarding sensitivity information for certain habitat types, particularly in deep-sea areas, and limitations in habitat data availability in regions like the Kattegat due to data confidentiality constraints.

The provided context focuses entirely on gaps related to benthic habitat assessment, particularly regarding commercial aggregate extraction impacts on seafloor habitats.

The identified gaps center on several critical areas: Data deficiency and lack of standardized data submission protocols represent fundamental challenges throughout the OSPAR Maritime Area, primarily attributed to restricted access to commercially sensitive information. Habitat data coverage remains incomplete, with high-resolution habitat data unavailable in certain regions like the Kattegat due to usage constraints and confidentiality issues.

Sensitivity assessment gaps include insufficient understanding of resistance and resilience characteristics of species and habitats, particularly at detailed biotope levels. The lack of annual extraction activity footprint data with standardized intensity measurements constitutes the largest knowledge gap for pressure data. Additionally, understanding of activity-pressure-receptor relationships requires substantial improvement through research at relevant spatiotemporal scales.

Technical limitations include the absence of consistent OSPAR-scale habitat classification systems and accurate translation methods between different habitat classification versions (EUNIS 2007, 2019, 2022). Reference condition habitat data and pressure-state relationships at regional scales remain limited, forcing reliance on expert knowledge and data extrapolation.

Geographical application remains constrained, with BH3 indicator assessment still under investigation for Arctic Waters and the Wider Atlantic due to limited data availability. Areas with data paucity show potential underreporting of habitat extent, particularly in deep-sea environments.

The assessment examines disturbance across 13 Benthic Habitat Types in different regions, with total disturbance being greatest in Circalittoral mixed sediment (0.46%). Physical disturbance was categorized as Low, Moderate, or High based on extraction intensity and habitat sensitivity. Only one example mentions potential beneficial effects: Sabellaria spinulosa reefs might benefit from increased suspended sediments caused by extraction activity, though this requires further research.

The report states that OSPAR envisions a North-East Atlantic Ocean that is ""resilient to climate change and ocean acidification,"" but the actual assessment focuses exclusively on physical pressures from human activities, particularly bottom-contact fishing.

The assessment methodology examines how marine species and habitats respond to physical disturbance through their resistance (ability to withstand disturbance) and resilience (ability to recover from disturbance). However, these resistance and resilience concepts are applied only to physical pressures like surface and subsurface abrasion from fishing gear, not to climate-related pressures.

The report identifies that all 20 distinct benthic habitat types experienced 'High' and/or 'Moderate' disturbance throughout the 2009-2020 assessment period, with mud habitats particularly affected. Deep-sea habitats and cold-water corals are noted as especially vulnerable due to their slow growth rates and low reproduction rates, making them less resilient to any form of disturbance, though this vulnerability assessment relates to fishing pressure rather than climate impacts.

Physical disturbance from bottom-contact fishing affected 86% of the Greater North Sea and Celtic Seas, with 58% highly disturbed. The assessment found that 74% of areas experienced consistent annual fishing pressure, likely preventing habitat recovery.

While the report establishes comprehensive methodologies for assessing pressure-receptor relationships and habitat sensitivity, these frameworks are not applied to climate change pressures.

Instead, the context focuses entirely on the impacts of physical disturbance from human activities, particularly fishing with mobile bottom-contacting gears, on marine benthic habitats and species.

The context details how physical pressures from human activities affect marine ecosystems through surface and subsurface abrasion. Key functional species that maintain community structure through predation or grazing face risks of population loss that would result in rapid, cascading changes throughout communities. Similarly, key structural species that provide distinct habitats supporting associated communities risk population degradation that would eliminate the habitats they create.

The assessment framework categorizes impacts based on severity: severe decline involves loss of 75% of species extent, density or abundance; significant decline represents 25-75% loss; and lower impacts affect less than 25% of populations. Habitat sensitivity varies considerably - fragile coral gardens show very high sensitivity while mobile sands demonstrate greater resistance and resilience to physical pressure.

Across the OSPAR Maritime Area, anthropogenic seafloor disturbance has caused shifts in benthic community composition, with large, long-lived species being replaced by small, fast-growing opportunistic species following disturbance. Deep-sea habitats and cold-water corals face particular vulnerability due to their typically slow rates of environmental change adaptation and long formation periods.

The assessment found that 86% of the Greater North Sea and Celtic Seas experienced disturbance, with 58% highly disturbed. Mud habitats, particularly circalittoral and offshore circalittoral mud, showed high disturbance across all assessment units where they occurred.

The assessment lacks commercially sensitive pressure data and has restricted access to such information. Habitat information is unavailable in all areas where pressure was reported, and no agreed OSPAR-scale habitat classification system exists. Reference condition habitat data and pressure-state relationships at the regional scale show limited availability, forcing reliance on expert knowledge and extrapolation of available pressure-state data.

High-resolution habitat data remain unavailable in areas like the Kattegat due to data usage constraints and confidentiality issues. The OSPAR Threatened and Declining Habitats GIS layer contains potentially outdated information with historic extents that may have changed during assessment periods, reducing confidence levels.

VMS (Vessel Monitoring Systems) data gaps are substantial, with 86% of the North-Iberian Atlantic assessment unit lacking coverage, predominantly in offshore deep-water areas. Data from fishing vessels under 12-15 meters are missing, particularly important for inshore areas. VMS data from Portugal and Norway were excluded due to quality assurance failures.

Habitat classification inconsistencies create translation problems between systems like EUNIS 2007, 2019, and 2022. The assessment requires better methods to translate between habitat classifications accurately to enable integrated assessments across the North-East Atlantic.

Sensitivity assessments lack coverage for certain biotopes, with habitat-specific sensitivity scores requiring further testing and validation. Understanding of ecosystem change responses to pressure needs data from unimpacted species and habitats as reference points.

However, the provided context contains no specific mention of climate change-related knowledge gaps, focusing instead on fishing pressure impacts and habitat disturbance assessments.",,"The OSPAR reports do not directly address climate change recommendations in the traditional sense of climate mitigation or adaptation strategies. However, the documents contain several recommendations for investigating ecosystem resilience - a key component of climate change preparedness - and identify numerous research gaps that require further investigation.

Regarding resilience strengthening, the reports recommend developing frameworks to account for resilient species present in less resilient habitats. Understanding of ecosystem change in response to pressure requires data from unimpacted species and habitats to serve as reference points when assessing sensitivity. Data from areas where fishing pressure has been removed, such as no-take zones, would improve understanding of receptor responses.

Critical research gaps requiring investigation include improving understanding of resistance and resilience of species and habitats through additional research at relevant spatiotemporal scales. Complete data on seafloor sensitivity to pressure and knowledge of activity-pressure-receptor relationships need acquisition. Future work investigating benthic habitat responses to consistent or variable abrasion pressure would inform how pressure impacts could be best represented across assessment periods.

Knowledge gaps remain in understanding biological responses to adverse effects caused by disturbance. The reports emphasize that data-based assessments of effects physical pressures have on benthic faunal and floral receptors will be explored when improved datasets become available to mitigate limitations affecting certainty and accuracy of indicator outputs.

Additional research needs include investigating the response of benthic habitats to pressure through availability of data from unimpacted reference sites, improving pressure-state relationships at regional scales, and developing better integration methods between benthic habitat indicators. Habitat-specific sensitivity scores require further testing and validation for improved application to future assessments.",,"The provided context contains only minimal information about ocean acidification. The report establishes that the North-East Atlantic Ocean should be ""resilient to climate change and ocean acidification,"" indicating ocean acidification is recognized as a threat requiring resilience measures.

However, the report is focused entirely on physical disturbance to benthic habitats from bottom-contact fishing activities rather than chemical changes like ocean acidification. The document extensively covers the BH3 indicator methodology, which assesses physical disturbance through surface and subsurface abrasion of the seafloor. It details habitat sensitivity assessments, fishing pressure mapping, and disturbance levels across different marine habitat types, but provides no data, analysis, or findings specifically related to ocean acidification impacts.

The report does note that deep-sea habitats and cold-water corals ""typically experience slow rates of change in environmental conditions"" and have ""slow growth rates, combined with low reproduction"" rates, making them particularly vulnerable to disturbance. While these characteristics would theoretically make such habitats vulnerable to ocean acidification, the document does not make this connection or discuss acidification effects.

The assessment methodology incorporates pressures defined by OSPAR's Intercessional Correspondence Group on Cumulative Effects, but ocean acidification is not among the physical pressures analyzed. The context is insufficient to provide any substantive information about ocean acidification beyond acknowledging it as a general concern requiring ecosystem resilience.",,"The provided context does not address ocean acidification impacts on species, habitats and ecosystems. The context exclusively focuses on physical disturbance to benthic habitats, particularly from bottom-contact fishing activities in the North-East Atlantic.

The available information details how physical pressures affect marine environments through surface and subsurface abrasion. Across the OSPAR Maritime Area, shifts in benthic community composition have occurred where large, long-lived species have been replaced by small, fast-growing opportunistic species following anthropogenic disturbance. The degree of impact depends on biological traits such as life history and physical structure.

Habitat sensitivity varies considerably - fragile coral gardens are very sensitive while mobile sands are more resistant and resilient to physical pressure. Deep-sea habitats and component species like cold-water corals typically experience slow environmental change rates and form over long periods, making them particularly vulnerable. Severe impacts are defined as 75% loss of extent, density or abundance of key species or habitat components, while significant impacts involve 25-75% loss.

Key functional species maintain community structure through interactions, and their loss results in rapid cascading changes. Characterizing species are important for habitat classification, with their degradation potentially changing habitat classification entirely. Physical disturbance can cause mortality of key species and affect physicochemical habitat character.

However, biological recovery can occur without complete physical seabed morphology recovery. The assessment focuses on potentially reversible biological community changes rather than permanent habitat loss. The context contains no information about ocean acidification's chemical effects on marine organisms or ecosystems.",,1,1,2

The report mentions that the expansion into Arctic Waters (Region I) may allow for more latitudinal variation in examining indicator trends, particularly concerning the effects of environmental change. However, no specific climate change impacts, data, or findings are presented.

The context focuses exclusively on grey seal pup production trends across OSPAR regions as a marine ecosystem indicator. Grey seal pup production is influenced by multiple factors including disease, pollutants, competition with other species, changes in prey distribution and abundance, disturbance, and fisheries interactions, but climate change effects are not specifically examined or quantified.

The report shows that grey seal pup production has generally increased over both long-term and short-term periods in assessed areas of the Greater North Sea and Celtic Seas, with all Assessment Units achieving their threshold values. Notable exceptions include Iceland, where pup production declined by 43% since the historical baseline and 10% between 2014-2019. Some areas like French North Sea & Channel Coast and Belgium Coast & Dutch Delta showed substantial increases of 133% and 962% respectively in short-term assessments.

The assessment acknowledges that environmental change may influence seal populations, but the report does not establish connections between observed population trends and climate change specifically. The context suggests that understanding environmental change effects requires broader latitudinal coverage, which the expanded monitoring into Arctic waters may provide, but no climate-related findings or analysis are presented in this document.",,"The provided context contains limited specific information about climate change threats or pressures. The expansion of grey seal pup production monitoring into Arctic Waters (Region I) may allow for more latitudinal variation in examining indicator trends, particularly concerning the effects of environmental change. However, the context does not elaborate on what specific climate change effects are anticipated or observed.

Grey seal pup production is influenced by multiple factors including changes in the distribution and abundance of prey, which could be related to climate impacts, though this connection is not explicitly made in the text. The assessment acknowledges that even without pressure from human activities, pup production cannot increase indefinitely and will stabilize as carrying capacity is reached, but does not specify climate change as a factor affecting this capacity.

The context mentions that further demographic studies could help predict likely future trends in pup production with and without impacts from human pressures, but climate change is not specifically identified among these pressures. The assessment framework seeks to identify effects of environmental change through expanded geographic coverage, but the nature of these environmental changes is not detailed.

The document discusses various anthropogenic pressures on grey seals including hunting, by-catch, disturbance from tourism, pollutants, and interactions with fisheries, but does not explicitly address climate change as a pressure or threat. While environmental change is acknowledged as a factor warranting investigation through expanded monitoring, the specific climate-related threats, impacts on prey distribution, habitat changes, or other climate pressures are not substantively addressed in the provided context.",,"The provided context does not directly address how climate change impacts species, habitats and ecosystems.

The context contains only one indirect reference to climate change impacts: the expansion of monitoring into Arctic Waters (Region I) may allow for examination of latitudinal variation in indicator trends, particularly concerning the effects of environmental change.

Instead, the context provides detailed information about grey seal population dynamics and the various factors affecting pup production. Grey seal pup production is influenced by disease, pollutants, competition with other species, changes in prey distribution and abundance, disturbance, and fisheries interactions. Grey seals serve as top predators that can indicate marine ecosystem health, with declining pup production potentially signaling unhealthy ecosystem conditions.

The context shows grey seal populations are recovering from historical depletion due to hunting, with long-term increases ranging from 12% to 1798% across different assessment units between 1992-2019. Some northern UK areas have reached carrying capacity and are experiencing leveling off in pup production. Recovery is largely UK-centric, with animals redistributing to continental European coasts as UK colonies reach capacity.

Human disturbance during breeding seasons is increasing across the North-East Atlantic from activities including tourism and recreation, though impacts on breeding success remain poorly understood. The relationship between breeding resource impacts and pup production outcomes requires further research, as does the extent of seal movements between assessment areas and their influence on local population trends.",,"Based on the provided context, several assessment gaps are identified, though these relate primarily to data limitations rather than climate change specifically. 

The expansion into Arctic Waters (Region I) may allow for more latitudinal variation in examining indicator trends, particularly concerning the effects of environmental change. However, within Arctic Waters, only Iceland had sufficient data to conduct an assessment, while Norwegian data from this region could not be assessed due to insufficient data points.

Multiple assessment units either lack enough data points to carry out assessments or use non-comparable data collection methods, leaving their outputs inconclusive. Assessment gaps result from insufficient annual and inter-annual data points to perform quantitative assessments of time series. Infrequent monitoring often stems from funding dependency or relatively few animals breeding in areas, making cost-effective monitoring difficult.

Limited information exists on the relationship between how breeding resources required by female grey seals may be impacted by human activity and where impacts on pup production would be realized. The extent of grey seal movement between assessment units during foraging and breeding seasons, and how this influences local pup production values, remains poorly understood.

Time series data for grey seal pup production do not indicate conditions when seal populations were unimpacted, making it impossible to identify baselines representing unimpacted conditions. This creates challenges in assessing seal status relative to favorable conservation status.

Further demographic studies could help predict carrying capacity and indicate likely future trends in pup production, with and without impacts from human pressures. Multi-country collaborative studies on individual seal movements could better address these knowledge gaps.",,"The provided context focuses on grey seal pup production assessment and does not contain specific recommendations regarding climate change. While the context mentions a vision for an ocean ""resilient to climate change and ocean acidification"" and notes that expansion into Arctic Waters may allow examination of ""effects of environmental change,"" it does not provide explicit climate change recommendations or research priorities.

The document does identify several areas requiring further investigation, though these relate to seal population dynamics rather than climate change specifically. The increasing frequency of reported disturbance events across the North-East Atlantic and their unquantified impacts on population status warrants further research. Multi-country collaborative studies on individual seal movements could help better understand how movement between assessment units influences local pup production. Demographic studies could predict carrying capacity for grey seals in the North-East Atlantic and indicate likely future trends with and without human pressure impacts.

Assessment value revisions may be needed for future assessments, and monitoring programmes require improvement to enhance power to detect trends. Several assessment units lack sufficient data points or comparable collection methods, leaving outputs inconclusive. The power to detect specified decline rates was low (around 20%) in some assessment units, particularly where monitoring occurs less than annually. The relationship between breeding resource impacts from human activity and locations where pup production impacts are realized remains poorly understood.

The key gaps identified include: Reference levels and targets need establishment to quantify natural background inputs of mercury, cadmium, and lead. Knowledge gaps remain concerning the retention and export of heavy metals in estuaries, limiting understanding of the proportion reaching marine environments. Limited knowledge exists regarding losses from harbours, shipping, historical dumping, and other potential sources.

Substantial data quality issues affect trend assessments. The land-based EMEP monitoring network provides validation data, but model product quality is less well validated over sea surfaces. Atmospheric deposition data uncertainties depend on reported emissions quality, accurate description of meteorological and chemical processes, and validation data quality. Estimated uncertainty in input calculations may reach 100-200% due to uncertainties in chemical concentration-runoff relationships, analytical methods, and flow measurements.

Monitoring challenges include insufficient procedures, inadequate spatial coverage, possible missing sources, and extremely uncertain historical data analyzed using poorer methods. Changes in analytical methods and laboratory quantification limits have introduced apparent trends unconnected to actual environmental inputs.

All indicator assessments,Inputs of nutrients to the OSPAR maritime area,OK,p00930_inputs_of_nutrients_qsr2023,"Climate change complicates efforts to establish causal links between nutrient enrichment and marine disturbances. Climate change produces cumulative effects that may have similar impacts on biological communities and dissolved oxygen as nutrient enrichment, making it difficult to demonstrate direct causal relationships between eutrophication and observed marine ecosystem changes.

Extreme weather events with periods of high river flow could become more frequent under continued warming. This presents monitoring challenges because identifying and capturing data during these high-flow periods before they decline is not always possible, resulting in less accurate estimates of nutrient inputs from individual rivers. These extreme events are so severe that statistical normalization techniques cannot fully remove their variation from nutrient input time series data.

The 2015 and 2019 extreme weather events in the Celtic Seas region resulted in nitrogen inputs equivalent to levels observed at the start of the monitoring period in 1990, despite overall declining trends. These events demonstrate how climate-related weather extremes can temporarily reverse progress in nutrient reduction.

The report identifies that weather normalization methods have been developed to account for meteorological variability in atmospheric nitrogen deposition modeling, using representative meteorological years to model the spreading and deposition of emissions. However, the increasing frequency of extreme weather events under warming conditions poses ongoing challenges for accurate nutrient input assessment and monitoring program effectiveness.

These climate change impacts create additional uncertainties in evaluating the success of nutrient reduction measures and complicate the assessment of eutrophication trends across OSPAR maritime regions.",,"Climate change represents a significant confounding factor in marine eutrophication assessment and monitoring within the OSPAR Maritime Area. Cumulative effects, including climate change, produce similar impacts on biological communities and dissolved oxygen levels as nutrient enrichment, substantially complicating efforts to demonstrate causal links between nutrient inputs and observed ecological disturbances. This overlap in effects makes it difficult to distinguish between impacts caused by excessive nutrients versus those resulting from climate-related pressures.

Climate change is intensifying monitoring challenges through more frequent extreme weather events. Periods of high flow associated with extreme weather events are expected to become more frequent under continued warming, directly affecting the accuracy of nutrient input estimates from individual rivers. The current monitoring system struggles to identify and monitor these high-flow periods before they decline, resulting in less accurate river input estimates than desired.

The climate-related increase in extreme weather events has particular relevance for nutrient monitoring because these events significantly influence the variability in nutrient inputs to marine systems. Flow normalization techniques are currently used to remove variability caused by wet and dry years when assessing nutrient trends, but the increasing frequency of extreme events under warming conditions presents ongoing challenges for maintaining accurate long-term assessments of nutrient reduction effectiveness and the success of management measures aimed at preventing eutrophication in the North-East Atlantic.",,"Climate change impacts marine biological communities and dissolved oxygen levels in ways that parallel eutrophication effects, creating significant complications for marine ecosystem assessment. The cumulative effects of climate change produce similar impacts on biological communities and dissolved oxygen as nutrient enrichment, making it difficult to demonstrate causal links between specific disturbances and their sources.

Climate change contributes to undesirable disturbances that include shifts in the composition and extent of flora and fauna, oxygen depletion due to decomposition of accumulated biomass, changes in habitats and biodiversity, blooms of nuisance algae or macroalgae, decreased water clarity, and behavioral changes or death of fish and other species. These effects mirror those caused by eutrophication, creating overlapping pressures on marine ecosystems.

Changes in nutrient ratios can alter phytoplankton community composition, with such changes already observed in the North Sea. The molar ratio of nitrogen to phosphorus in inflowing freshwater has shifted significantly - in the Celtic Seas and Bay of Biscay regions, ratios changed from around 40 in 1997 to about 60, indicating increasing phosphorus limitation in most areas except the Arctic.

Extreme weather events, which may become more frequent under continued warming, create periods of high nutrient flow that complicate monitoring efforts. These events can produce nitrogen inputs equivalent to those at the start of monitoring time series, as occurred in the Celtic Seas in 2015 and 2019, demonstrating how climate-driven weather patterns interact with nutrient dynamics to affect marine ecosystems.",,"Several significant knowledge gaps related to climate change are identified in OSPAR's nutrient monitoring and eutrophication assessment capabilities.

Extreme weather events with periods of high flow are expected to become more frequent under continued warming, creating substantial monitoring challenges. Currently, identifying and monitoring these high-flow periods before they decline is often not possible, resulting in less accurate estimates from individual rivers. This limitation is particularly problematic because these extreme events can produce nitrogen inputs equivalent to those at the beginning of monitoring time series, as occurred in the Celtic Seas during 2015 and 2019. Flow normalization techniques were unable to fully remove the variation caused by these extreme events.

Climate change complicates the identification of causal links between nutrient enrichment and biological disturbances. Cumulative effects, including climate change, may produce similar effects on biological communities and dissolved oxygen as nutrient enrichment, making it difficult to demonstrate direct causal relationships between eutrophication and its impacts.

The monitoring infrastructure shows critical deficiencies for climate-related assessments. OSPAR's RID monitoring programme involves compromises between cost and data coverage that limit the ability to capture climate-driven variability. Atmospheric phosphorus deposition remains effectively unknown with no observations over sea areas and no operational modeling capabilities. More frequent sensor observations are needed to reduce uncertainty, particularly during extreme weather events.

OSPAR Contracting Parties lack fundamental knowledge of critical nutrient input thresholds required to eliminate eutrophication and prevent future occurrences under changing climate conditions. This knowledge gap is being addressed urgently under the North-East Atlantic Environment Strategy, but represents a significant limitation for climate adaptation planning.",,"The provided context focuses primarily on nutrient input monitoring and eutrophication assessment rather than comprehensive climate change recommendations. However, several climate-related issues requiring further investigation emerge from the technical analysis.

Extreme weather events with periods of high flow could become more frequent under continued warming, creating significant monitoring challenges. Current river monitoring systems cannot always identify and measure these high-flow periods before they decline, resulting in less accurate nutrient input estimates from individual rivers. This limitation is particularly problematic because such extreme events may increase in frequency with climate change.

Climate change complicates eutrophication assessment by producing cumulative effects that may have similar impacts on biological communities and dissolved oxygen as nutrient enrichment. These overlapping effects make it difficult to demonstrate direct causal links between nutrient inputs and marine disturbances, hampering efforts to evaluate the effectiveness of nutrient reduction measures.

Key research gaps requiring urgent attention include the lack of knowledge regarding critical nutrient inputs needed to eliminate eutrophication and prevent future occurrences. This knowledge gap is being addressed under the North-East Atlantic Environment Strategy. Atmospheric phosphorus deposition remains effectively unknown, with no observations over the sea, few land-based observations, and no operational modeling capabilities.

Technical improvements needed include developing sensors for more frequent river monitoring, particularly during high-flow conditions associated with extreme weather. Enhanced atmospheric monitoring requires better model resolution, data assimilation techniques, and more detailed emissions data. Analyzing atmospheric nitrogen deposition by country could help target reduction measures more effectively, while improved flow normalization methods are needed to account for increasing weather variability.",,"Based on the provided context, ocean acidification receives minimal direct discussion in this OSPAR report.

The only explicit reference to climate change appears in a general statement about achieving an ocean that is ""resilient to climate change and ocean acidification.""

The context focuses primarily on marine bird abundance indicators and assessment methodologies rather than climate-related threats. However, several findings suggest environmental pressures affecting marine bird populations that could be related to climate impacts, though climate change is not explicitly identified as the cause:

Marine bird communities show declining health across most OSPAR regions, with less than 75% of species achieving threshold values for relative breeding abundance in three out of four assessed regions. Non-breeding species populations are declining since the start of time-series in all assessed OSPAR regions. There has been a decline in the proportion of breeding species achieving threshold values since the mid-2000s or earlier in all regions except the Bay of Biscay and Iberian Coast.

The assessment notes that breeding and non-breeding bird populations indicate impacts from different suites of pressures operating in different parts of the marine environment. Rapid changes in abundance can indicate human-induced impacts, and some species experience potentially disruptive population increases that impact other species.

The context acknowledges that marine bird species from different areas can be subject to very different pressures, and that different flyway populations face varying threats. However, the specific nature of climate-related pressures, their mechanisms, or their relative importance compared to other threats is not detailed in this material.",,"Based on the provided context, this OSPAR report focuses specifically on marine bird abundance as an indicator of marine ecosystem health, but does not directly address climate change impacts on species, habitats, and ecosystems. The document examines marine bird populations across OSPAR regions as indicators of environmental pressures but does not explicitly identify climate change as a causal factor.

The report demonstrates significant ecological changes occurring across marine environments. Marine bird breeding populations have declined since the mid-2000s or earlier in all OSPAR regions except the Bay of Biscay and Iberian Coast, where populations appear stable. Non-breeding species populations are declining across all assessed OSPAR regions since the start of the time-series. In three of four OSPAR regions, less than 75% of species achieved threshold values for relative breeding abundance, indicating unhealthy bird communities.

The assessment reveals complex species interactions where some species benefit while others decline. Large predatory seabird species like great black-backed gull and great skua have increased due to food provisioning from fishery discards, leading to predation-driven declines in species such as kittiwakes. These population changes indicate human-induced impacts operating through different pressure suites across marine environments.

The marine bird communities show varying responses across functional groups, with less than 75% of benthic feeders and wading feeders achieving threshold values in all assessed regions. The assessment covers species dependent on coastal and offshore marine areas, including those using estuaries, beaches, and saltmarshes.

However, the context provided does not contain specific information about climate change impacts on species, habitats, and ecosystems, limiting the ability to comprehensively answer the question as posed.",,"The provided context does not specifically address gaps in relation to climate change. The document focuses on marine bird abundance monitoring and identifies various data and methodological gaps, but these are not explicitly connected to climate change research or assessment needs.

The gaps identified relate to marine bird monitoring and include: missing geographical coverage from Greenland, Iceland, Faroe Islands, Ireland, Portugal, and Russia; insufficient data from the Wider Atlantic region preventing assessment; lack of at-sea survey data, with current monitoring limited to land-based counts that miss offshore species; poor coordination between countries regarding survey timing and methods; and incomplete temporal coverage, with the assessment period shifted from 1980-2020 to 1991-2020 due to data scarcity prior to 1991.

Additional gaps include difficulties in establishing appropriate baselines, with few countries able to supply baselines and COVID-19 hindering efforts to address this; challenges in assessing different populations and subspecies separately, particularly for non-breeding birds from different areas of origin subject to different pressures; and methodological needs for developing joint survey concepts and data aggregation approaches.

While the context mentions that marine ecosystems should be managed ""to avoid significant adverse impacts, including by strengthening their resilience,"" and notes that ""rapid changes in abundance can indicate human-induced impacts,"" there is no specific discussion of climate change-related knowledge gaps, monitoring needs, or research priorities. The gaps described are primarily focused on improving current marine bird monitoring capabilities rather than addressing climate change impacts or adaptation needs.",,"The provided context does not contain specific recommendations about climate change or identify issues requiring further investigation related to climate change impacts. The context focuses entirely on marine bird abundance assessments and monitoring methodologies across OSPAR regions from 1991-2020.

The only reference to climate change appears in a vision statement (which per instructions should be ignored) about achieving oceans ""resilient to climate change and ocean acidification,"" but this contains no substantive recommendations or research needs.

The context does identify several areas requiring further investigation and research related to marine bird monitoring, but these are methodological rather than climate-focused: Enhanced coordination between countries for joint survey efforts is needed, along with development of concepts for delivering data for abundance indicator work and methodological approaches for aggregating data. Contracting Parties must improve baseline estimation using available data, as few countries provided baselines for previous assessments and COVID-19 hindered efforts to address this gap. Future assessments should include at-sea monitoring data collected from boats and planes to obtain reliable results for offshore species, as current assessments omit non-breeding populations staying offshore. Different flyway populations and subspecies should be assessed separately when distinguishable, particularly for non-breeding birds subject to different pressures in different origin areas. 

The assessment acknowledges data gaps from missing countries including Greenland, Iceland, Faroe Islands, and the Russian Federation, and notes insufficient data prevented viable assessment of the Wider Atlantic region.

However, none of these research needs or data gaps are explicitly connected to climate change impacts or climate-related investigations in the provided context.",,"The provided context contains only two brief mentions of ocean acidification, both stating the same thing: the North-East Atlantic Ocean should be ""resilient to climate change and ocean acidification."" However, the context provides no substantive scientific findings, data, measurements, trends, impacts, or analysis specifically about ocean acidification itself.

The entire document focuses exclusively on marine bird abundance assessments across OSPAR regions, examining breeding and non-breeding populations, threshold values for species decline, and monitoring methodologies.

The context consists entirely of technical details about marine bird abundance assessments in OSPAR regions, including methodologies for measuring breeding and non-breeding bird populations, threshold values for species assessments, and trends in bird community health across different functional groups.

The context focuses on bird population trends and their use as indicators of marine ecosystem health, with detailed breakdowns by region (Arctic Waters, Greater North Sea, Celtic Seas, and Bay of Biscay and Iberian Coast) and functional feeding groups (surface feeders, water-column feeders, benthic feeders, wading feeders, and grazing feeders). The assessments show declining trends in bird populations, with less than 75% of species achieving threshold values for relative breeding abundance in three out of four OSPAR regions assessed, indicating unhealthy bird communities.

All indicator assessments,Marine bird breeding productivity,OK,p00846_b3_bird_breeding_productivity_qsr2023,"Climate change impacts on marine bird breeding productivity are explicitly identified through multiple mechanisms. Extreme weather events and flooding of nests can affect productivity, both expected to increase with climate change. Climate-driven perturbations in prey-fish availability represent another pathway by which climate affects breeding success.

The report acknowledges that distinguishing between natural and climate-induced effects on breeding performance is challenging and not always possible. Climate change is positioned as one of several stressors affecting marine bird populations, alongside human disturbance, contaminants, and predation by invasive species.

Surface-feeding seabirds show particularly concerning trends, with the proportion experiencing sufficient breeding productivity falling below the 75% threshold in every year since 1991 in the Greater North Sea and Celtic Seas, and in most years since 2010 in the Arctic Waters. Very few surface feeders in the Greater North Sea (3 of 14 species) showed sufficient breeding productivity during the six-year study period.

The breeding productivity indicator serves as a sensitive early warning system for environmental changes, reflecting alterations in conditions long before population-level impacts become evident. Marine bird breeding productivity functions as an indicator of marine ecosystem ability to support higher trophic level predators, making it valuable for detecting climate-related ecosystem changes.

Current breeding productivity levels in some species, such as black-legged kittiwakes in OSPAR Region II, are insufficient to prevent population declines toward extinction, with expected annual population declines of 3.7% or 67% over three generations.",,"The OSPAR report identifies several specific climate change threats and pressures affecting marine bird populations in the North-East Atlantic. Climate change drives perturbations in prey-fish availability, directly impacting seabird breeding success since commercial fisheries and seabirds often target the same prey species. This creates a fundamental pressure on the marine ecosystem's ability to support higher trophic level predators.

Extreme weather events pose an increasing threat, with flooding of nests affecting breeding productivity. Both extreme weather events and nest flooding are expected to increase with climate change, representing escalating pressures on marine bird populations. These climate-driven impacts compound other stressors including human disturbance, contaminants, and predation by invasive species.

The breeding productivity indicator serves as an early warning system for climate change impacts, as marine birds are long-lived species with delayed maturity, meaning changes in their reproductive success reflect environmental changes before population size changes become evident. The assessment reveals concerning trends, with only 39% of assessed species in the Greater North Sea, 59% in the Celtic Seas, and 58% in Arctic Waters maintaining sufficiently high breeding productivity to avoid long-term population declines during 2014-2019.

Climate-driven changes in prey availability represent a particularly significant pressure, as they affect the fundamental food web dynamics that support seabird populations. The report notes that distinguishing between natural climate variability and human-induced climate effects on breeding performance is challenging and often impossible, complicating management responses. Surface-feeding seabirds appear particularly vulnerable, with breeding productivity falling below sustainable thresholds in multiple regions since the early 1990s, indicating sustained climate-related pressures on marine ecosystems.",,"Climate change impacts marine species, habitats and ecosystems through multiple mechanisms affecting breeding productivity and population viability. Extreme weather events and flooding of nests reduce breeding productivity, both effects expected to increase with climate change. Climate-driven perturbations in prey-fish availability directly affect marine bird breeding success, as these species depend on stable food sources during critical breeding periods.

The breeding productivity data reveals concerning regional patterns. In the Greater North Sea, only 39% of assessed species maintained sufficiently high breeding productivity to avoid long-term population declines during 2014-2019. The Celtic Seas showed 59% and Arctic Waters 58%, while the Bay of Biscay and Iberian coast achieved 100%. Surface-feeding species were particularly vulnerable, with their proportion achieving sufficient breeding productivity falling below 75% threshold levels in most years since 1991 in the Greater North Sea and Celtic Seas, and since 2010 in Arctic Waters.

Marine bird breeding productivity serves as a sensitive early warning indicator of ecosystem health, reflecting environmental changes long before population size changes become apparent. These long-lived species with delayed maturity respond to climate-driven environmental perturbations affecting their ability to support higher trophic level predators. Current breeding productivity levels in some species, such as black-legged kittiwakes in certain regions, are insufficient to prevent population declines toward extinction. The assessment demonstrates that climate change, combined with other stressors including human disturbance, contaminants, and invasive species predation, creates cumulative impacts on marine ecosystem productivity and resilience.",,"The OSPAR report identifies several significant gaps related to climate change impacts on marine bird breeding productivity assessment. Climate change poses multiple threats to seabirds, with extreme weather events and flooding of nests affecting productivity - both impacts expected to increase with climate change. Distinguishing between natural and human-induced effects on breeding performance is challenging and not always possible.

The assessment methodology contains a major knowledge gap: it assumes constant values for age-specific survival rates, when annual estimates could provide more accurate results if available. This limitation affects the accuracy of population models used to predict how breeding productivity impacts long-term population growth rates.

Climate-driven perturbations in prey-fish availability represent natural factors affecting the breeding productivity indicator, alongside predation and disturbance from native predators. The indicator could provide evidence of climate change impacts alongside other stressors including human disturbance, contaminants and invasive species predation.

Significant data coverage gaps limit comprehensive assessment across OSPAR regions. The Wider Atlantic lacks data entirely as Portugal provided no information despite monitoring some populations. The Arctic Waters assessment was confined largely to Norwegian coasts due to wider data unavailability. Denmark provides no breeding productivity monitoring data for the Greater North Sea. German Wadden Sea data were unavailable despite coordinated monitoring schemes. Iceland's Atlantic puffin data proved unusable due to insufficient abundance data for constructing productivity models.

These gaps prevent region-wide comprehensive assessments needed to understand climate change impacts on marine bird populations across the North-East Atlantic, limiting the indicator's effectiveness for detecting ecosystem-wide responses to changing environmental conditions.",,"Based on the provided context, climate change recommendations are limited but specific. The report identifies that extreme weather events and flooding of nests can affect seabird productivity, both expected to increase with climate change. Climate-driven perturbations in prey-fish availability represent natural factors affecting marine bird breeding productivity indicators.

A critical research gap identified is the challenge of distinguishing between natural and human-induced effects on breeding performance, which is described as challenging and not always possible. This represents a fundamental limitation in understanding climate change impacts versus other anthropogenic pressures on marine ecosystems.

The report recommends strengthening ecosystem resilience and taking restoration actions to achieve healthy and productive oceans that are resilient to climate change and ocean acidification. However, specific methodological approaches for building this resilience are not detailed in the provided context.

Several monitoring and data gaps require investigation to better understand climate change impacts. OSPAR Contracting Parties should implement monitoring of breeding productivity or extend existing schemes to species and groups not yet covered, enabling more comprehensive, region-wide assessments. Arctic region countries beyond Norway are encouraged to make data available for future assessments, as current coverage is largely confined to Norwegian coasts. Portugal should provide data for the Wider Atlantic regions, where no data were available.

The breeding productivity indicator serves as evidence for climate change impacts alongside effects from human disturbance, contaminants, and invasive species predation. An integrated population model approach is recommended to replace current separate indicators for marine bird abundance, breeding productivity, and mortality assessments, which would provide more comprehensive understanding of climate change effects on marine bird populations.",,"The provided context contains very limited information specifically about ocean acidification. Ocean acidification is mentioned only twice, both times in identical organizational vision statements referencing a goal for the North-East Atlantic Ocean to be ""resilient to climate change and ocean acidification.""

The document focuses entirely on marine bird breeding productivity as an indicator of ecosystem health. While it acknowledges that marine bird breeding productivity can provide evidence of climate change impacts, it does not discuss ocean acidification as a specific driver or factor affecting marine birds or marine ecosystems more broadly.

The assessment examines breeding productivity across different OSPAR regions (Arctic Waters, Greater North Sea, Celtic Seas, Bay of Biscay and Iberian Coast) from 1986-2020, finding that surface feeders experienced insufficient breeding productivity below the 75% threshold in most regions and years.

The document extensively covers marine litter threats, documenting that fulmar populations in Europe have declined by more than 40% since the mid-1980s, with similar declines reported across North Atlantic populations (35% decline in Iceland over three decades, 58% decline in 25 years on Bear Island, Svalbard). Plastic debris ingestion is considered a potential contributing threat to these population declines, though hard evidence for causation remains difficult to obtain. Individual fulmars suffer severely from excessive plastic ingestion, with sub-lethal effects potentially having broader population impacts that are difficult to quantify.

However, regarding climate change specifically, the context provides insufficient information to address the question about climate-related threats or pressures. The analysis is limited to marine plastic pollution impacts on seabird populations and does not examine climate change effects on marine ecosystems or species.",,"Based on the provided context, climate change impacts on species, habitats and ecosystems cannot be comprehensively answered as the document focuses exclusively on marine plastic pollution and its effects on northern fulmars rather than climate change impacts.

The context addresses marine plastic pollution impacts on marine ecosystems. Many marine organisms including seabirds, turtles, marine mammals, fish, crustaceans, shellfish, and zooplankton ingest man-made debris in their marine environment. Individual fulmars and other wildlife can die and suffer severely from ingesting excessive quantities of plastic, though such effects are difficult to quantify in terms of population or species reductions. Sub-lethal effects on many individuals may have population-level consequences across the ecosystem, even if these are difficult to quantify for fulmars and other species.

The fulmar population demonstrates concerning trends. In Europe, fulmar populations declined by more than 40% since the mid-1980s. Similar or stronger declines occurred in other North Atlantic populations, including a 35% decline over three decades in Iceland and an alarming 87% decline in Canadian Arctic study colonies. Within the EU, the species is classified as 'Endangered' on the IUCN Red List. More vulnerable or threatened species may become extinct from marine litter even when indicator species like fulmars remain abundant.

The document establishes that plastic ingestion by marine wildlife reflects litter abundance in their environment and represents harm to wildlife and marine ecosystems. However, the monitoring system provides only indirect measures of harm rather than direct evidence of damage. The context acknowledges that urgent experimental laboratory research is needed to strengthen evidence of specific harm from plastic ingestion levels and types.",,"Based on the provided context, there are no explicit mentions of gaps specifically related to climate change. The context focuses entirely on marine litter monitoring through fulmar stomach contents and does not discuss climate change impacts, adaptation, or related knowledge gaps.

The knowledge gaps identified in the OSPAR report relate exclusively to marine litter research. The fulmar monitoring effort does not provide direct information on 'harm' or 'damage' but only quantifies spatial and temporal patterns in plastic abundance as an indirect measure of harm. Dedicated experimental laboratory research into evidence of harm to fulmars from specified levels and types of plastics is urgently needed to strengthen the role of the OSPAR Common Indicator.

Additional gaps include the limitation of using fulmar as a single indicator species. To understand the full extent of the marine litter problem in a wider context, further development of other indicator species is necessary. The monitoring system currently reflects litter floating at the surface and potential harm to pelagic marine organisms, but broader ecosystem impacts remain inadequately assessed.

Further research to document individual sub-lethal effects on fulmars and other species in the ecosystem is warranted, as these effects may have population-level consequences that are difficult to quantify. Small national sample sizes in some periods create statistical challenges, requiring longer timeframes to reach statistical significance for trends, though they contribute to broader regional analyses.

The context does not address climate change-related knowledge gaps, climate adaptation strategies, or climate monitoring needs within the OSPAR assessment framework.",,"The provided context does not contain specific recommendations regarding climate change, nor does it identify climate change-related issues requiring further investigation or research. The context focuses exclusively on marine litter monitoring through plastic particles in fulmar stomachs in the North Sea, with detailed analysis of plastic ingestion rates, monitoring methodologies, and assessment frameworks.

The only mention of climate change appears in OSPAR's organizational vision statement referencing ""resilience to climate change and ocean acidification,"" but no substantive climate-related findings, recommendations, or research needs are presented in the technical content.

The document's recommendations center entirely on marine litter reduction. Conservation actions include identification and protection of important sites at sea, continued monitoring of marine litter ingestion, and increased efforts for plastic removal from oceans. Research gaps identified relate specifically to plastic pollution impacts: dedicated experimental laboratory research into evidence of harm to fulmars from specified levels and types of plastics is urgently needed, further research to document sub-lethal effects on individuals and populations is warranted, and development of additional indicator species beyond fulmars is necessary to understand the full extent of marine litter problems.

The OSPAR long-term goal to reduce plastic ingestion by seabirds was not achieved anywhere in the North Sea during 2014-2018, with 51% of fulmar stomachs containing more than 0.1g of plastic versus the target reduction. Global background plastic levels could change relatively quickly if new debris input is effectively stopped, according to research findings cited.

All technical content addresses marine plastic pollution rather than climate change impacts or adaptation strategies.",,"Based on the provided context, ocean acidification is mentioned only in passing as part of a broader environmental challenge. The report references the need for the North-East Atlantic Ocean to be ""resilient to climate change and ocean acidification,"" but provides no substantive analysis, data, findings, or discussion about ocean acidification itself.

The context is entirely focused on marine litter monitoring, specifically plastic ingestion by northern fulmars as an indicator of marine pollution in the North Sea. The report contains extensive technical information about fulmar stomach contents, plastic particle measurements, monitoring methodologies, trends in marine debris, and associated ecological impacts. It discusses how fulmar monitoring serves as an indicator for marine litter floating at the surface, with detailed findings about plastic ingestion rates, temporal trends, and policy implications for marine litter reduction.

However, the context contains no information addressing ocean acidification specifically - no measurements of pH levels, carbonate chemistry, impacts on marine organisms, trends over time, or any scientific analysis related to acidification processes.

All indicator assessments,Proportion of large fish (Large Fish Index),OK,p00939_fc2_large_fish_indix_qsr2023,"The report identifies climate change as a significant factor expected to depress the recovery of the Large Fish Index in the long term, contrasting with fishing at Maximum Sustainable Yield which is expected to promote recovery. This assessment is based on research by Queirós et al. (2018).

Specific knowledge gaps exist regarding the effects of warming sea temperature on Large Fish Index threshold values and on demersal fish size composition recovery rates. The report indicates insufficient understanding of how temperature changes will affect both the assessment benchmarks used to evaluate fish community health and the speed at which fish communities can recover their size structure.

The analysis acknowledges that warming sea temperatures represent a key uncertainty in predicting how demersal fish communities (species living on or near the seafloor) will respond to management measures. However, the report lacks comprehensive data on actual temperature changes or their observed impacts on fish size composition across the OSPAR Maritime Area.

The document also references ocean acidification alongside climate change as factors requiring resilience-building measures for marine ecosystems, though no specific analysis of acidification impacts on fish communities is provided.

The climate change discussion remains limited to these broad projections and identified research needs. The report does not present observed climate-related changes in fish communities or quantify temperature trends in the study regions. The primary focus remains on fishing pressure impacts, with climate change treated as an important but incompletely understood modifier of fish community recovery potential.",,"Climate change emerges as a significant long-term threat to demersal fish communities in the OSPAR Maritime Area. Research indicates that climate change will depress the recovery of the Large Fish Index (LFI) in the long term, directly counteracting expected improvements from sustainable fishing practices. While fishing at Maximum Sustainable Yield is expected to lead to indicator recovery, climate change pressures work in opposition to this positive trend.

The effects of warming sea temperatures represent a critical knowledge gap requiring urgent attention. Specifically, scientists lack understanding of how warming sea temperatures will affect LFI threshold values and demersal fish size composition recovery rates. This represents a fundamental uncertainty in predicting how fish communities will respond to combined pressures from both fishing and climate change.

The warming ocean temperatures pose particular concerns for the proportion of large fish in demersal communities - species living on or near the seafloor. These communities have already experienced substantial depletion during the 1980s and 1990s due to fishing pressure, and climate change threatens to compound these impacts by potentially slowing or reversing recovery efforts.

Current assessment methods and threshold values may become inadequate under changing climate conditions, as the effects of temperature change on fish size composition and community structure remain poorly understood. This creates challenges for effective management and conservation of marine ecosystems, particularly given that some regions show evidence of recent recovery that could be jeopardized by climate pressures. The interaction between climate change and other human pressures on demersal fish communities requires comprehensive investigation to develop effective adaptive management strategies.",,"Climate change impacts marine fish communities by depressing the long-term recovery of the Large Fish Index, which measures the proportion of large fish in demersal (bottom-dwelling) communities. While fishing at Maximum Sustainable Yield is expected to lead to indicator recovery, climate change counteracts this positive effect over extended timeframes.

Warming sea temperatures specifically affect fish communities in several ways. Temperature increases influence Large Fish Index threshold values, alter the baseline measurements used to assess ecosystem health, and impact demersal fish size composition recovery rates. These effects create challenges for establishing appropriate assessment criteria and predicting how quickly fish communities can bounce back from previous depletion.

Historical data reveals that depletion of large fish proportions occurred during the 1980s and 1990s in the North Sea and Firth of Clyde, with time series extending back to the 1920s documenting these changes. Recent surveys show ongoing recoveries during the 2000s and 2010s across multiple regions, with significant shifts to higher stable states in several areas. However, some regions like the Irish Sea show mixed recovery patterns depending on survey location.

Critical knowledge gaps exist regarding climate change impacts on marine ecosystems. These include insufficient understanding of how warming temperatures affect threshold values for fish community assessments, limited comprehension of how temperature changes influence recovery rates of demersal fish size composition, and inadequate historical data for most regions outside the North Sea and Firth of Clyde. Additionally, the full relationships between climate change and other human pressures on demersal fish communities remain poorly understood.",,"The OSPAR report identifies several critical climate-related gaps concerning the Large Fish Index (LFI) assessment. The primary climate change gap centers on understanding the effects of warming sea temperatures on LFI threshold values and on demersal fish size composition recovery rates. This represents a significant knowledge limitation since the report establishes that climate change is expected to depress the recovery of the indicator in the long term.

The warming sea temperature effects are particularly concerning because they impact both the establishment of appropriate threshold values for assessment and the rates at which demersal fish communities can recover their size composition. This creates uncertainty in both setting meaningful targets and predicting recovery timelines under changing thermal conditions.

Additionally, there is a lack of historical data for seas other than the North Sea and Firth of Clyde, which limits the ability to develop appropriate models for informing LFI threshold value setting under different climate scenarios. This data gap is compounded by insufficient understanding of relationships between all human pressures and their impact on the full demersal fish community, not just commercially fished stocks.

The report notes that while fishing at Maximum Sustainable Yield is expected to lead to indicator recovery, climate change effects work in opposition to this recovery. Without adequate models accounting for warming temperatures, threshold values may become increasingly inappropriate as thermal conditions change, potentially leading to misassessment of ecosystem health and ineffective management responses in marine areas experiencing significant temperature increases.",,"Based on the OSPAR report context provided, the recommendations and research needs related to climate change focus specifically on the Large Fish Index (LFI) indicator and demersal fish communities. 

Climate change is expected to depress the recovery of the LFI indicator in the long term, contrasting with fishing at Maximum Sustainable Yield which is expected to lead to recovery. This creates a fundamental tension between fishing pressure recovery and climate impacts on fish community size structure.

The report identifies critical knowledge gaps requiring further investigation centered on warming sea temperatures. Specifically, research is needed to understand the effects of warming sea temperature on LFI threshold values and on demersal fish size composition recovery rates. These gaps are highlighted alongside the lack of historical data for seas other than the North Sea and Firth of Clyde, and the absence of appropriate models to inform LFI threshold value setting.

The research recommendations emphasize developing a full understanding of relationships between all human pressures and their impact on the complete demersal fish community, not just commercially fished stocks. Future indicator development should explore using assessment units that split OSPAR Regions into smaller areas and include fishing pressure metrics.

The context establishes that marine ecosystems need strengthening of resilience to avoid significant adverse impacts, with the goal of achieving healthy and productive oceans that are resilient to climate change and ocean acidification. However, the specific recommendations are limited to fish community indicators rather than broader climate adaptation strategies across marine ecosystems.",,"Based on the provided context, ocean acidification receives extremely limited coverage in this OSPAR report. The document focuses entirely on the Large Fish Index (LFI) assessment for demersal fish communities in the North-East Atlantic.

Ocean acidification is mentioned only briefly as a stressor that marine ecosystems need to be resilient to, appearing solely in visionary statements about maintaining a productive and sustainable North-East Atlantic Ocean. No scientific findings, data, measurements, or specific analysis of ocean acidification impacts are presented in this context.

The report does identify climate change as a factor expected to depress the recovery of the Large Fish Index in the long term, and notes knowledge gaps regarding the effects of warming sea temperature on LFI threshold values and demersal fish size composition recovery rates. However, ocean acidification is not examined as a separate climate-related stressor affecting fish communities.

The document extensively covers fish population trends, fishing pressure impacts, and recovery patterns across different OSPAR regions from the 1980s through recent years, but provides no substantive information about ocean acidification's current status, trends, or ecological impacts in the North-East Atlantic.

All indicator assessments,Recovery of sensitive fish species,OK,p00851_recovery_sensitive_fish_fc1_qsr23,"Based on the provided OSPAR report context, climate change is mentioned as a pressure affecting sensitive fish species populations, but with significant knowledge gaps identified. Climate change impacts populations of sensitive species alongside fishing pressures, though fishing remains the primary documented pressure across the assessment area over the past century.

The most significant finding regarding climate change is a critical knowledge gap: the effects of warming seas on the potential for population recovery among sensitive fish species remains unknown. This gap hampers the ability to set absolute recovery targets and fully understand ecosystem recovery potential.

The assessment reveals mixed population outcomes for sensitive fish species across OSPAR regions, with 49% of 114 assessed populations achieving recovery thresholds and 32% showing stable long-term outcomes. However, 21 populations continue declining long-term, and 18% of regionally integrated outcomes failed to achieve either recovery threshold. Ten populations showing long-term failure are also exhibiting recent population declines.

While the report establishes that sensitive species with K-type life-history traits (large body size, slow growth, late maturation, lower fecundity) are particularly vulnerable to additional mortality from fishing, the specific mechanisms by which climate change affects these populations remain uncharacterized. The assessment methodology does not yet account for seasonality effects, which could be relevant to climate change impacts on highly migratory species.

The context indicates that understanding climate change effects on sensitive fish populations represents a fundamental research priority, as warming seas may significantly influence recovery potential, but current assessment capabilities cannot quantify these relationships.",,"Climate change poses several identified threats to marine ecosystems and sensitive fish species in the OSPAR Maritime Area. The effects of warming seas on the potential for population recovery among sensitive fish species represents a critical knowledge gap that limits current assessment capabilities. This warming pressure specifically affects the recovery prospects of species already vulnerable due to their life-history characteristics.

Species with K-type life-history traits (large body size, slow growth rate, late age and larger size at maturation, lower fecundity) are particularly sensitive to additional mortality, making them vulnerable to multiple pressures including climate change. These climate-related impacts compound existing pressures from fishing activities that have been intense across the assessment area for over a century.

The assessment reveals concerning patterns potentially linked to climate pressures. Despite 49% of assessed populations showing long-term recovery and 82% achieving stability or recovery, 18% of populations failed to achieve either threshold and continue declining. In the short term, 11% of populations show recent declines, with mixed outcomes evident across different surveys, suggesting complex interactions between recovery efforts and ongoing environmental pressures.

Current monitoring systems lack sufficient data to fully understand climate change impacts. The absence of historic data or suitable models for ecosystem recovery hampers the setting of absolute recovery targets for sensitive species. Additionally, the assessment methodology does not yet account for seasonality effects or the highly migratory nature of some species, both factors potentially influenced by changing ocean conditions. These limitations prevent comprehensive evaluation of how warming seas may be affecting the 87 populations of sensitive species that currently cannot be assessed due to insufficient data.",,"Based on the provided OSPAR report context, the analysis focuses specifically on how climate change impacts sensitive fish species populations, with limited broader ecosystem information available.

Climate change emerges as a significant pressure affecting populations of sensitive fish species, alongside fishing mortality. The report identifies a critical knowledge gap regarding ""the effects of warming seas on the potential for population recovery among sensitive fish species,"" indicating that warming ocean temperatures may hinder the recovery of depleted populations.

The assessment reveals mixed outcomes for sensitive fish species recovery across OSPAR regions. Of 114 assessed populations, 49% achieved recovery thresholds in the long term, while 82% either stabilized or recovered. However, 18% of populations failed to achieve either threshold and continued declining long-term, with regional variations: 7% declining in Bay of Biscay and Iberian Coast, 27% in Celtic Seas, 21% in Greater North Sea, 20% in Wider Atlantic, and 15% of deep-sea species in the Porcupine Bank area.

Species with K-type life-history traits (large body size, slow growth, late maturation, lower fecundity) are particularly vulnerable to additional mortality pressures, including climate change impacts. These characteristics make them especially sensitive to environmental changes and reduce their capacity to recover from population depletion.

The report notes that 87 populations remain data-poor or unassessed, limiting comprehensive understanding of climate impacts. Deep-sea species show particularly concerning trends, with only 31% achieving recovery objectives in assessed areas.

While the context establishes climate change as an important factor affecting marine species populations, it lacks detailed mechanisms of how climate change specifically impacts habitats and broader ecosystem functions beyond sensitive fish species recovery patterns.",,"The assessment identifies two primary knowledge gaps related to climate change effects on sensitive fish species recovery. First, there is insufficient availability of historic data or suitable models for ecosystem recovery to support the setting of absolute recovery targets for sensitive fish species. Second, the effects of warming seas on the potential for population recovery among sensitive fish species remain poorly understood.

The report acknowledges that climate change can impact populations of sensitive species, alongside other pressures such as fishing mortality. However, the current assessment methodology cannot adequately account for these climate-related effects. The warming seas knowledge gap is particularly significant because it directly affects the ability to predict and support population recovery among species already vulnerable to additional mortality.

Additional methodological limitations compound these climate-related knowledge gaps. The assessment methodology does not yet account for seasonality effects, which could be important for understanding climate impacts on highly migratory species. Spatial autocorrelation in datasets also remains unaddressed, limiting the refinement of integration methodology. Future methodology improvements are planned to address seasonality and spatial autocorrelation issues.

Many populations of sensitive species could not support assessment within the current indicator framework, partly because trawl surveys are not the most suitable monitoring method for certain species. Some species, such as basking sharks, have particularly low catchability in trawl surveys, meaning assessments can only ever result in ""unknown"" outcomes. Alternative assessment methods, including mark-recapture studies or citizen science observations, may prove useful for future assessments of these challenging species.

These gaps limit the ability to set appropriate recovery targets and understand how climate change specifically affects the recovery potential of sensitive fish populations across OSPAR regions.",,"Based on the provided OSPAR report context, the recommendations in relation to climate change are limited, with the document identifying critical knowledge gaps rather than comprehensive recommendations.

The report identifies two key climate-related research priorities requiring further investigation. First, there is a critical need to understand the effects of warming seas on the potential for population recovery among sensitive fish species. This represents a fundamental knowledge gap affecting the ability to set appropriate recovery targets. Second, the availability of historic data or suitable models for ecosystem recovery to support the setting of absolute recovery targets for sensitive fish species requires investigation.

The document acknowledges that climate change can impact populations of sensitive species alongside fishing pressures, but the assessment methodology focuses primarily on fishing-related impacts. The report notes that species with K-type life-history traits are particularly sensitive to additional mortality from fishing, but other pressures including climate change also affect these populations.

From a methodological perspective, several areas require further research. The assessment methodology needs improvement to address spatial autocorrelation in datasets and seasonality issues, particularly relevant for highly migratory species. Many populations could not support assessment because trawl surveys are not suitable monitoring methods for all species. Alternative assessment approaches through mark-recapture studies or citizen science observations may prove useful for species with low catchability in trawl surveys.

The broader recommendation centers on strengthening ecosystem resilience and taking action for restoration to achieve healthy and productive oceans. However, the report primarily focuses on recovery from fishing impacts rather than providing specific climate change adaptation or mitigation strategies. The knowledge gaps identified represent the most concrete areas where climate-related research is needed to improve future assessments and management approaches.",,"The provided context contains very limited information about ocean acidification.

Additionally, 82% of assessable populations have achieved the secondary threshold of either recovering or remaining stable, indicating that further population decline has been halted for most species.

The assessment identifies significant knowledge gaps including the effects of warming seas on population recovery potential among sensitive fish species, and the availability of historic data for setting absolute recovery targets. However, these findings relate to fishing pressure impacts and general climate effects rather than ocean acidification specifically.

The substantial context provided details seal population trends, monitoring methodologies, and various pressures affecting seals including disease, pollutants, competition with other species, changes in prey distribution and abundance, disturbance, and anthropogenic removals such as by-catch, hunting and culling. Grey seal populations have increased substantially since 1992 across the Greater North Sea, Celtic Seas, and Arctic Waters, while harbour seal populations show mixed trends with declines in some areas like South-East England (16% decline between 2014-2019) and increases in others.

To answer the question about climate change impacts on species, habitats and ecosystems, different source material containing specific climate impact data and analysis would be required.",,"Based on the provided context, several key knowledge gaps are identified in relation to climate change and environmental changes affecting seal populations:

**Monitoring and Data Collection Gaps:**
Data collection requires improvement across all assessment units and regions, with monitoring frequency needing enhancement to increase assessment power. Statistical power to detect harbour seal population decline rates of 1% per year remains low (around 20%) in assessment units where monitoring occurs less than annually. Some assessment units lack sufficient data points, preventing any assessment on either long-term or short-term scales.

**Climate Change and Environmental Effects:**
The expansion of monitoring into Arctic Waters (Region I) was specifically implemented to allow greater latitudinal variation in examining indicator trends, particularly concerning environmental change effects. However, the context indicates this represents an ongoing need rather than a fulfilled requirement.

**Research and Understanding Gaps:**
More research is needed to establish direct links between seal population changes and human activities. The baseline conditions representing un-impacted seal populations cannot be identified, making it impossible to determine what undisturbed populations would look like in terms of abundance and distribution. This creates challenges in assessing ""favourable conservation status.""

**Species Interactions and Ecosystem Understanding:**
Interactions between grey and harbour seal populations require investigation to develop understanding of how these species impact each other. The reasons for harbour seal declines in some units while others remain stable are unclear, triggering needs for further investigation.

**Assessment Methodology:**
Threshold values may require revision for future assessments, and monitoring programmes need improvement to enhance trend detection power, particularly where natural population fluctuations occur.",,"The provided context contains no direct recommendations specifically related to climate change. The document is focused entirely on seal abundance and distribution assessments in the OSPAR Maritime Area, analyzing harbour seal and grey seal populations across various Assessment Units.

While the context mentions that OSPAR's vision includes an ocean ""resilient to climate change and ocean acidification,"" it does not provide any specific climate change recommendations. The document's recommendations center exclusively on seal monitoring and research needs.

The recommended research priorities include: improving data collection and monitoring frequency across all regions to enhance assessment power; adopting similar survey methodologies across OSPAR regions to allow better data aggregation; reducing uncertainty in seal abundance estimates through improved monitoring programs; conducting further studies into the reasons for historic population declines; investigating interactions between grey and harbour seal populations; and expanding geographic coverage to areas where seals occur but surveys don't take place.

The document identifies several knowledge gaps requiring investigation: determining whether population changes are natural or human-induced; assessing relationships between pressures and outcomes to inform management measures; understanding implications of grey seal population increases; establishing direct links between population trends and human activities; and improving statistical power to detect population decline rates, particularly where monitoring occurs less than annually.

The expansion of assessments into Arctic Waters (Region I) is noted as allowing for examination of environmental change effects across greater latitudinal variation, but this represents the only tangential reference to environmental change in the context provided. The document's scope is specifically limited to seal population dynamics rather than broader climate change considerations.",,"Based on the provided context, ocean acidification is mentioned only in passing within the broader context of marine environmental challenges. The document identifies ocean acidification as one of the environmental stressors that the North-East Atlantic Ocean needs to be resilient against, alongside climate change.

The only explicit mention of climate change appears in OSPAR's stated vision for ""a clean, healthy and biologically diverse North-East Atlantic Ocean, which is productive, used sustainably and resilient to climate change and ocean acidification.""

The document focuses primarily on benthic habitat assessment using the BH1 indicator to measure disturbance from bottom trawling activities across different marine areas from 2009-2020 and 2016-2020. The analysis examines how fishing pressure affects sentinel species populations in various habitat types including circalittoral mud, circalittoral sand, and mixed sediments across assessment units like the Gulf of Biscay, North Iberian Atlantic, South Iberian Atlantic, and Gulf of Cadiz.

While the methodology acknowledges that environmental variables can affect sentinel species abundance and suggests incorporating environmental covariates could improve model accuracy, there is no substantive analysis of climate change impacts, temperature trends, sea level changes, or other climate-related variables. The document mentions that BH1 can detect changes from ""any physical or chemical disturbances"" if species sensitivity is known, but does not specifically apply this to climate-related pressures.

The assessment demonstrates widespread habitat disturbance from trawling activities, with areas showing 62.5-96.5% disturbance across different regions, but does not connect these findings to climate change impacts or analyze how climate factors might influence benthic habitat conditions or species responses.",,"Based on the provided context, climate change is mentioned only as a future aspirational goal rather than as an assessed threat or pressure. The document references a vision for an ocean that is ""resilient to climate change and ocean acidification,"" but provides no analysis, data, or findings about climate change-related threats or pressures.

The report focuses exclusively on anthropogenic pressures from bottom trawling activities, analyzing swept area ratios and their impacts on benthic habitats through sentinel species responses. Environmental variables are acknowledged as potentially affecting sentinel species proportional abundance, particularly in habitats with high environmental variability like Upper Bathyal Sediment, but these are not specifically linked to climate change pressures.

The assessment identifies that future indicator development should incorporate multiple pressures beyond trawling, noting that BH1 has demonstrated ability to analyze seafloor impacts from eutrophication, pollution, and bottom trawling effort. The methodology shows potential for assessing cumulative effects of multiple pressures acting simultaneously, which is identified as important for comprehensive habitat assessment.

However, climate change is not analyzed as one of these pressures. The document acknowledges that areas are exposed to multiple pressures and that assessment efforts should be directed toward analyzing impacts of other pressures beyond the currently widespread trawling impacts, but climate change-specific threats, data, or pressure indicators are not presented in the available context.

Instead, the document focuses exclusively on the impacts of anthropogenic physical disturbances, specifically bottom trawling, on benthic marine habitats in the OSPAR Maritime Area.

The context contains detailed information about how anthropogenic disturbances (primarily trawling pressure measured as swept area ratio) produce changes to habitat condition, including modifications in species composition and their functions. The document describes the BH1 indicator methodology, which assesses habitat environmental status using the proportional abundance of sentinel species across pressure gradients from trawling activities.

Key findings include that anthropogenic disturbances cause habitat degradation with varying sensitivities across different habitat types. Upper bathyal sediment and offshore circalittoral mud habitats showed the most sensitive responses (sensitivity 4), with sharp decreases in sentinel species proportions at initial pressure values. Other habitats like offshore circalittoral mud and sand from North Iberian Atlantic showed moderate sensitivity (sensitivity 3) with quasi-linear responses to pressure.

The assessment reveals significant habitat condition loss across multiple areas, with all offshore and circalittoral broad benthic habitat types experiencing areas of high disturbance. The document establishes pressure-state curves and quality thresholds specific to each habitat type based on their sensitivity to trawling disturbance, but contains no information about temperature changes, ocean acidification effects, species range shifts, or other climate-related impacts on marine ecosystems that would directly answer the question about climate change impacts.",,"The report identifies several critical gaps in understanding climate change impacts on benthic habitats. For the next evaluation cycle, the objective is to move towards quantitative analysis of low uncertainty for all areas.

A fundamental gap exists in incorporating environmental variables into the BH1 assessment method. The sentinel species assessed are sensitive to trawling pressure, but environmental variables may also affect their proportional abundance, especially in habitats with wide environmental variability such as the Upper Bathyal Sediment. Because the BH1 indicator uses a correlative approach to convert pressure layers into sentinel species proportion values, other environmental layers can be included as covariates in the correlative approach. Taking into account underlying environmental variation could increase model accuracy and substantially improve prediction models.

The assessment method has been tested primarily for bottom trawling and some pollution pressures, but requires expansion to analyze impacts from other pressures. This is particularly important when areas are exposed to multiple pressures simultaneously. The BH1 indicator offers opportunities to develop new methods for assessing cumulative effects of multiple pressures acting simultaneously, which is especially relevant for comprehensive ecosystem assessment.

Access to more data with high accuracy will improve confidence and coherence in assessment results. The BH1 indicator is sensitive to data quality, which dictates the power and utility of resultant information. Current assessments are hampered by lack of information on habitat condition and relationships with imposed pressures, preventing implementation of integrated ecosystem-based approaches to achieve good environmental status of benthic habitats.",,"Based on the provided context, there are no explicit recommendations regarding climate change contained in this OSPAR report. The context focuses exclusively on benthic habitat assessments using the BH1 indicator to evaluate seafloor disturbance from fishing pressures and other anthropogenic impacts.

The only reference to climate change appears in OSPAR's organizational vision statement about achieving a North-East Atlantic Ocean ""resilient to climate change and ocean acidification,"" but this contains no specific recommendations or research needs.

The report identifies several areas requiring further investigation and research, but these relate to improving benthic habitat assessments rather than climate change specifically. Key research needs include: developing methods to assess cumulative effects of multiple pressures acting simultaneously; incorporating environmental variables as covariates to improve model accuracy; expanding assessment efforts to analyze impacts of pressures beyond bottom-contacting fishing activities; improving spatial resolution of vessel monitoring system data; establishing standardized benthic monitoring programmes; increasing biological sampling data coverage in the Gulf of Biscay and South Iberian Atlantic; developing continuous gridded habitat mapping products; and establishing agreed criteria for defining ecologically meaningful quality thresholds.

The report emphasizes moving toward quantitative analysis with low uncertainties for future assessment cycles and improving three types of information: benthic habitat distribution, pressure distribution and intensity, and biological sampling data across pressure gradients. However, none of these research priorities or recommendations specifically address climate change impacts, adaptation, or mitigation measures for marine benthic habitats.",,"The provided context contains only two brief references to ocean acidification. The document states that the North-East Atlantic Ocean should be ""resilient to climate change and ocean acidification."" However, this appears only as part of an organizational vision statement mentioned twice in the text.

The remainder of the 107-page document focuses entirely on the Sentinels of the Seabed (BH1) indicator assessment, which evaluates benthic habitat condition in response to bottom trawling pressure across the OSPAR Maritime Area from 2009-2020. The assessment examines sentinel species proportions, habitat sensitivity, and fishing pressure impacts on seabed habitats in regions including the Gulf of Biscay, North Iberian Atlantic, South Iberian Atlantic, and Gulf of Cadiz.

While the document mentions that the BH1 indicator ""can detect changes in the community composition of marine habitats produced by any disturbance, physical or chemical if the species sensitivity to these disturbances is known,"" and specifically notes it has been applied to analyze impacts from ""eutrophication and pollution and bottom trawling effort,"" ocean acidification is not identified as one of the pressures analyzed or discussed as a factor affecting benthic habitats in this assessment.

The context consists entirely of technical details about the BH1 (Sentinels of Seabed) indicator assessment, which focuses exclusively on evaluating benthic habitat condition in response to bottom trawling pressure, not ocean acidification.

The document examines how anthropogenic disturbances, specifically fishing trawling activities measured as Swept Area Ratio (SAR), affect benthic habitats across the OSPAR Maritime Area from 2009-2020. It analyzes changes in sentinel species proportions across pressure gradients to assess habitat sensitivity and condition. Different habitat types show varying sensitivities to trawling pressure, with upper bathyal sediment and offshore circalittoral mud habitats demonstrating high sensitivity (sensitivity level 4) and showing sharp decreases in sentinel species proportions at low pressure values.

The assessment reveals significant habitat condition losses in offshore circalittoral mud, circalittoral sand, and upper bathyal sediment habitats across various geographic areas including the Gulf of Biscay, North Iberian Atlantic, South Iberian Atlantic, and Gulf of Cadiz. Heavy habitat condition losses were concentrated in specific areas, such as along the Galician coast and Brittany coast.

All indicator assessments,Size composition in fish communities,OK,p00852_size_composition_fish_communities_qsr23,"The OSPAR report identifies climate change as a key factor affecting fish body size in marine ecosystems. Rising sea temperatures serve to reduce body size of fish, with this temperature-related process representing one of the mechanisms that can adversely impact fish communities through changes in their size structure.

The report establishes that the Typical Length indicator can respond to environmental pressures that impact fish indirectly through changes in their seabed or pelagic habitat, primary production, and food-web interactions - pathways through which climate change effects manifest. However, the assessment acknowledges a critical knowledge gap: further investigation is required to identify whether observed reductions in the size structure of fish assemblages are due to human activities, food web interactions, or prevailing climatic conditions.

The EU VECTORS project, which informed this assessment, specifically examined significant changes taking place in European seas, their causes, and their societal impacts. This broader context of ecosystem change provides the framework within which climate impacts on fish communities are being evaluated.

The report's findings show complex regional patterns in fish size structure across the North-East Atlantic, with mixed outcomes of increases, decreases, and no change evident across different areas including the North Sea, Celtic Seas, and Bay of Biscay regions. These variable patterns reflect the complex interplay between climate effects, fishing pressure, and other environmental factors affecting marine fish communities.

The assessment methodology acknowledges that populations should occur at levels ensuring long-term sustainability ""in line with prevailing climatic conditions,"" recognizing climate as a fundamental factor shaping ecosystem baselines and assessment outcomes.",,"Based on the provided context, climate change pressures on marine ecosystems are identified through several key mechanisms affecting fish communities. Rising sea temperatures directly reduce fish body size, as documented processes related to increasing sea temperature serve to decrease the body size of fish species. This temperature-driven size reduction compounds with other pressures to alter fish community structure.

The report identifies that reductions in fish assemblage size structure require further investigation to determine whether they result from human activities, food web interactions, or prevailing climatic conditions. The Typical Length indicator responds to marine environment pressures that impact fish both directly and indirectly through changes in seabed or pelagic habitat, primary production, and food-web interactions - all of which can be influenced by climate change.

Climate pressures interact with other stressors in complex ways. Model simulations demonstrate that large species at high trophic levels are highly sensitive to diversity loss at lower trophic levels. As large-bodied predatory fish decline, smaller forage fish experience reduced predation mortality, further decreasing typical fish length and indicating adversely impacted food webs.

The EU VECTORS project examined significant changes occurring in European marine ecosystems, investigating their causes and societal impacts, suggesting climate change is among the major drivers of ecosystem transformation. However, the current assessment methodology cannot definitively separate climate-related impacts from other human activities or natural food web interactions when analyzing long-term changes in fish community structure. This represents a significant knowledge gap requiring further research to understand climate change's specific contribution to observed ecosystem changes.",,"Based on the provided context, climate change impacts on marine species, habitats and ecosystems are primarily manifested through temperature-related effects on fish body size and food web structure. Rising sea temperatures directly reduce the body size of fish, contributing to shifts in marine community composition. This temperature-driven reduction in body size represents a fundamental biological response affecting individual organisms and scaling up to ecosystem-level changes.

The climate impacts interact with complex food web dynamics, where large species at high trophic levels demonstrate high sensitivity to diversity loss at lower trophic levels. Model simulations reveal that in food webs dominated by predator-prey interactions, the decline of large-bodied piscivores leads to reduced predation mortality on smaller forage fish, further decreasing typical fish lengths and indicating adversely impacted food webs.

Climate change effects operate through multiple pathways including changes to seabed and pelagic habitats, alterations in primary production, and modifications to food-web interactions. These changes can impact fish both directly and indirectly, with the size structure of fish assemblages integrating these impacts over long time periods.

However, the assessment identifies significant analytical limitations. Further investigation is required to distinguish whether observed reductions in assemblage size structure result from human activities, food web interactions, or prevailing climatic conditions. Analytical baselines are not currently available to determine assessment thresholds for size-structure associated with healthy ecosystems, and any historical baseline likely represents an already impacted state, necessitating multi-species modeling approaches for proper evaluation.",,"The report identifies several critical knowledge gaps specifically related to climate change impacts on fish communities. Further investigation is required to identify if reductions in the size structure of fish assemblages are due to human activities, food web interactions, or prevailing climatic conditions. Currently, analytical capabilities cannot distinguish between these different drivers of change, creating a significant uncertainty in understanding climate-related impacts on marine ecosystems.

The assessment methodology itself presents climate-related gaps. The minimum detectable period for changes is set at six years to capture fish community responses rather than noise, but this timeframe may not adequately capture longer-term climatic variations. The choice of assessment periods creates challenges - shorter periods risk comparing natural fluctuations or climatic noise against each other, while longer periods may average out actual climate-driven changes in ecosystem state.

Baseline establishment presents another climate-related gap. Appropriate baselines and assessment values for fish size indicators require further evaluation because any historical baseline for fish and elasmobranch communities likely represents an already impacted state. Assessment values should preferably be identified through multi-species modeling, but current analytical baselines are not available to determine assessment thresholds for size-structure associated with healthy assemblages under different climatic conditions.

The indicator responds to pressures that impact fish indirectly through changes in seabed or pelagic habitat, primary production, and food-web interactions - all processes heavily influenced by climate change. However, the current assessment approach cannot separate these climate-driven habitat and food web changes from direct human pressures, limiting understanding of how marine ecosystems will respond to ongoing climate change and ocean acidification.",,"Based on the provided context, the recommendations and research needs related to climate change focus on understanding climate impacts on marine ecosystems and building resilience, though specific climate recommendations are limited in this technical report.

The primary climate-related recommendation centers on ecosystem resilience. Marine and coastal ecosystems should be sustainably managed and protected to avoid significant adverse impacts, including strengthening their resilience and taking action for restoration to achieve healthy and productive oceans. The North-East Atlantic Ocean should be resilient to climate change and ocean acidification.

Several critical research gaps require investigation. Further investigation is required to identify whether reductions in the size structure of fish assemblages result from human activities, food web interactions, or prevailing climatic conditions. This represents a fundamental knowledge gap in attributing observed changes to specific drivers including climate.

The report identifies that processes related to rising sea temperature serve to reduce body size of fish, indicating climate change impacts are already affecting marine ecosystems. However, analytical baselines are not currently available to determine assessment thresholds for size-structure associated with healthy and sustainably fished assemblages under changing climate conditions.

Additional research needs include evaluating appropriate baselines and assessment values for indicators, as any historical baseline for fish and elasmobranch communities likely represents an already impacted state. Assessment values should preferably be identified through multi-species modelling to account for complex ecosystem interactions under climate change.

The assessment methodology acknowledges that fish populations should occur at levels ensuring long-term sustainability in line with prevailing conditions, recognizing that climate conditions are changing and management approaches must adapt accordingly.",,"Based on the provided context, ocean acidification receives extremely limited discussion in this OSPAR report.

The document references work examining ""significant changes taking place in European seas"" but does not specify ocean acidification among these changes in the provided passages.

The context is insufficient to provide any meaningful analysis of what this OSPAR report says about ocean acidification beyond acknowledging it as a challenge requiring ecosystem resilience.

While ocean acidification is mentioned twice as a threat requiring ecosystem resilience, the document focuses exclusively on fish community size structure and the Typical Length indicator assessment.

The context does reveal broader ecosystem impacts from other pressures. Rising sea temperatures reduce body size of fish, while fishing pressure over long periods affects size structure of fish assemblages. Model simulations show that in food webs dominated by predator-prey interactions, large species at high trophic levels are highly sensitive to loss of diversity at lower trophic levels. As large-bodied piscivores decline, smaller forage fish experience reduced predation mortality, further decreasing typical length and indicating adversely impacted food webs.

Fish community indicators respond to marine environment pressures that impact individual fish directly through entrapment activities or indirectly through changes in seabed or pelagic habitat, primary production and food-web interactions. The North Sea showed long-term decreases in typical length to minimum levels during the 1990s, with partial recovery from the early 2000s. Celtic Seas showed mixed outcomes with increases in Irish Sea and Bristol Channel but decreases in deep shelf edge waters. Bay of Biscay showed variable patterns with some subdivisions increasing while shelf edge areas decreased.

Further investigation is required to determine whether reductions in size structure result from human activities, food web interactions or climatic conditions. Assessment baselines representing healthy, sustainably fished assemblages remain unavailable.",,3,1,5
All indicator assessments,"Status and trends for heavy metals (Mercury, cadmium and lead) in fish, shellfish and sediment",OK,p00902_qsr2023_heavy_metals_sediment_biota,"Climate change impacts mercury behavior and concentrations in marine environments through multiple pathways. Higher temperatures increase oxidation rates of mercury in the atmosphere, leading to changes in deposition patterns. More forest fires release mercury from terrestrial soils, while increased precipitation leads to higher depositions generally. Oxygen depletion creates conditions for higher methylmercury production in anoxic sediments, releasing it into the water column.

Higher temperatures also increase the uptake rate of mercury in food-webs, and ice-free arctic regions change food-web dynamics, all leading to higher mercury concentrations in arctic regions. Mercury's volatility and long-range transport properties make it particularly sensitive to climate change effects.

Climate change may explain observed increases in trace metal concentrations in marine biota despite decreasing inputs from air and rivers. While sediments show decreasing trends of around -3% yearly change, fish and shellfish show increasing trends of 2-4% yearly change in several subregions including the Southern North Sea, Channel, and Northern Bay of Biscay. This contradictory pattern suggests either internal release from sediments to water and marine organisms, or changes in metal uptake by fish and shellfish due to higher temperatures.

The increasing concentrations of cadmium have spread from the Southern North Sea to Northern North Sea and Channel subregions, while lead and mercury show more upward than downward trends across more regions than previously observed. These temperature-related changes in metal bioavailability and uptake represent a significant climate change impact requiring further investigation to identify specific sources and environmental processes.",,"Climate change creates multiple pathways that increase mercury threats and pressures in marine environments. Mercury's volatility and long-range transport properties make it particularly sensitive to climate effects. Higher temperatures increase oxidation rates of mercury in the atmosphere, altering deposition patterns across regions. Increased forest fires, driven by climate change, release additional mercury from terrestrial soils into the environment.

Climate-driven precipitation changes lead to higher mercury depositions generally. Ocean warming creates more oxygen-depleted conditions, which increases methylmercury production in anoxic sediments and releases it into the water column. Higher temperatures also accelerate uptake rates in marine food webs, concentrating mercury as it moves up trophic levels.

Arctic regions face particularly severe impacts as ice-free conditions alter established food webs, contributing to higher mercury concentrations in these areas. The data show concerning trends with mercury concentrations increasing 2-4% yearly in fish and shellfish across the Southern North Sea, Channel, and Northern Bay of Biscay, despite decreasing trends in sediments.

Climate change may also affect other trace metals, with evidence suggesting that higher temperatures alter metal uptake rates in fish and shellfish. The report indicates that upward trends in biological tissues contrast with generally downward sediment trends, potentially reflecting climate-induced changes in metal bioavailability and uptake processes.

These climate-related pressures compound existing anthropogenic mercury sources, with the combination creating complex environmental challenges that require further investigation to understand the full scope of climate change impacts on marine metal contamination.",,"Climate change significantly impacts marine species and ecosystems through multiple pathways affecting toxic metal cycling and bioaccumulation. Higher temperatures increase oxidation rates of mercury in the atmosphere, altering deposition patterns across marine environments. Forest fires, intensified by climate change, release mercury from terrestrial soils into the atmosphere for subsequent marine deposition. Increased precipitation leads to higher mercury depositions generally.

Ocean warming creates oxygen-depleted conditions that enhance methylmercury production in anoxic sediments, releasing this toxic form into the water column. Higher temperatures increase metal uptake rates in marine food webs, while ice-free Arctic regions fundamentally alter food web structures, collectively driving higher mercury concentrations in Arctic marine ecosystems.

The warming ocean affects metal bioavailability through enhanced uptake mechanisms in fish and shellfish. Despite decreasing atmospheric and riverine inputs, metal concentrations in marine organisms are increasing - mercury shows 2-4% yearly increases in fish and shellfish across multiple regions, while cadmium increases 2.5-3.5% annually and lead increases 4% yearly in some areas. This occurs even as sediment concentrations decrease, suggesting climate-driven changes in biogeochemical processes are releasing metals from sediments into the water column and increasing organism uptake rates.

These climate impacts particularly affect Arctic marine mammals and birds, which accumulate extremely high mercury concentrations due to long food chains and long-range atmospheric transport. The combination of altered atmospheric mercury cycling, changed precipitation patterns, ocean deoxygenation, and modified food web dynamics creates cascading effects throughout marine ecosystems, fundamentally altering species exposure to toxic metals.",,"Based on the OSPAR report context provided, several significant gaps related to climate change are identified:

**Knowledge and Understanding Gaps:**
The report identifies a critical need to develop better understanding of why trace metal concentrations in fish and shellfish are increasing despite perceived decreasing inputs to the marine environment. This phenomenon may be linked to climate-related processes, as the increasing concentrations could result from internal release from sediments to water and marine organisms, or changes in metal uptake due to higher temperatures.

**Assessment Methodology Gaps:**
There is a lack of ecotoxicological data for developing new assessment criteria based on Water Framework Directive or Environmental Assessment Criteria principles. Thresholds for trace metals in sediments, fish and shellfish require development or updating. Additionally, missing agreed assessment criteria and conversion factors between organs represent major knowledge gaps.

**Climate-Related Process Understanding:**
The report notes that mercury is particularly sensitive to climate change effects. Higher temperatures increase atmospheric mercury oxidation rates, alter deposition patterns, increase forest fires that release mercury from terrestrial soils, and can increase uptake rates in food-webs. More oxygen depletion leads to higher methylmercury production in anoxic sediments. Ice-free Arctic regions can change food-webs, potentially leading to higher mercury concentrations.

**Monitoring Coverage Gaps:**
Several regions have insufficient monitoring stations with adequate geographic coverage to estimate regional trends or status. Sediment data are not available from the Arctic, and some areas like Northern Bay of Biscay lack sediment data for temporal trend analysis.",,"Based on the OSPAR report context, climate change significantly affects mercury behavior and bioaccumulation in marine environments. Higher temperatures increase mercury oxidation rates in the atmosphere, altering deposition patterns, while increased forest fires release mercury from terrestrial soils and higher precipitation leads to greater general depositions. More oxygen depletion produces higher methylmercury in anoxic sediments, releasing it into the water column. Higher temperatures also increase mercury uptake rates in food-webs, and ice-free Arctic regions change food-webs, all leading to higher mercury concentrations in Arctic regions.

Climate change appears linked to increasing trace metal concentrations in fish and shellfish despite decreasing inputs from air and rivers. Higher temperatures may cause changes in metal uptake rates in marine organisms or internal release from sediments to water and marine organisms.

Key research needs identified include investigating why trace metal concentrations in biota are increasing, particularly in the Southern North Sea and Channel, despite perceived decreasing environmental inputs and decreasing sediment trends. The mechanisms behind potential internal release from sediments to water with increasing uptake in shellfish and fish require further investigation. Links between metal concentrations and confounding factors like organism size, condition, trophic level, and dry weight/lipid concentrations need investigation.

Additional research priorities include developing better understanding of sources and environmental processes driving increasing biota concentrations, establishing standard distribution factors between different fish organs for metals across species, and extending monitoring to top predator species like marine mammals and seabirds where new information could be gained.",,"The provided context contains only minimal information about ocean acidification. Ocean acidification is mentioned twice in identical statements about resilience to climate change and ocean acidification as a desired outcome for the North-East Atlantic Ocean. However, the context primarily focuses on trace metal contamination (mercury, cadmium, and lead) in marine environments.

The substantial technical content addresses trace metal concentrations in fish, shellfish, and sediments across OSPAR regions from 1979-2020. Key findings include increasing metal concentrations in biota despite decreasing inputs from air and rivers, with copper showing the most concerning upward trends across five subregions. In the Channel and Southern North Sea, adverse biological effects from trace metals cannot be ruled out. The upward trends in fish and shellfish contrast with generally downward trends in sediments, potentially indicating internal release from sediment to water and marine organisms, or changes in metal uptake due to higher temperatures.

Climate-related factors affecting metal behavior include increased precipitation leading to higher depositions, oxygen depletion causing higher methylmercury production in anoxic sediments, and higher temperatures increasing uptake rates in food webs. However, these represent indirect connections to climate change rather than specific ocean acidification impacts.

The context does not provide any direct scientific findings, data, measurements, trends, or analysis specifically related to ocean acidification processes, impacts, or monitoring in the OSPAR Maritime Area.

Adverse biological effects on marine organisms by trace metals cannot be ruled out in the Channel and Southern North Sea, where concentrations exceed Effects Range-Low thresholds. The increasing trends in biota occur despite decreasing inputs from air and rivers, potentially due to internal release from sediments or changes in metal uptake due to higher temperatures.

However, some pollution sources mentioned could have indirect climate connections. PAHs enter the marine environment through atmospheric deposition, road run-off, industrial discharges, and oil spills, with incomplete combustion of fossil fuels and organic material being major sources. Forest fires, which can be climate-influenced, are noted as natural PAH sources.

Shellfish from the same region showed decreasing trends for 5 out of 14 PAHs.

Knowledge gaps are identified, particularly insufficient monitoring data for sediment in Arctic waters and inadequate geographic spread of monitoring sites in some assessment areas. Environmental Assessment Criteria for alkylated PAHs in shellfish need development.

While climate change is mentioned once in an organizational vision statement, the document focuses entirely on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) monitoring and assessment, without examining climate-related knowledge gaps.

The context does identify several significant knowledge gaps in PAH monitoring and assessment. There is a lack of monitoring data, particularly for sediment in Arctic waters, and insufficient monitoring sites with adequate geographic spread for status and trends assessment in some areas. Only four assessment areas (Northern North Sea, Southern North Sea, Channel, Irish Sea) had sufficient data for the first OSPAR bile metabolite assessment in fish.

Critical assessment criteria gaps exist for PAHs. Environmental Assessment Criteria (EACs) are absent for PAHs in sediment, requiring the use of Effects Range-Low (ERL) values as an interim solution. EACs need development for alkylated PAHs in shellfish, as current criteria only cover parent PAHs. The limitations in using existing EACs and Background Assessment Concentrations (BACs) require further research to address.

Methodological limitations include EACs not accounting for specific long-term biological effects such as carcinogenicity, genotoxicity, and reproductive disruption due to hormone imbalances, nor combination toxicology effects. Less is known about alkylated PAH toxicity compared to parent compounds.

The context identifies several key monitoring and assessment gaps: Few monitoring sites exist for assessing temporal trends and status of PBDE in sediment outside of Regions II and III, making the assessment unrepresentative for the OSPAR Maritime Area as a whole. For sediment monitoring, coverage is limited to the Greater North Sea and the Celtic Seas, while biota monitoring provides good coverage across all OSPAR regions and most assessment areas.

The assessment identifies methodological gaps requiring attention. A strategy is needed to make data from different monitoring species, such as shellfish and different trophic level fish, comparable, as PBDE bioaccumulate differently across congeners and species. The EU Environmental Quality Standard requires further investigation before implementation in the OSPAR Maritime Area.

Cooperation between OSPAR and the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme could improve access to data for Region I, addressing geographical coverage limitations.

Temporal coverage varies, with PBDE observations in biota spanning 1999-2020 and sediment data covering 2006-2020.

The document does identify several areas requiring further investigation, but these relate to TBT contamination and antifouling substances rather than climate change. Specifically, current risk assessment procedures may underestimate environmental risks because they fail to account for changes in the speciation of dissolved copper and zinc that may increase the proportion of metals considered bioavailable. There are good reasons to further investigate whether current use of TBT substitutes are ecologically sustainable, as studies show antifouling paint use leads to exceedance of both Environmental Quality Standards and Predicted No Effect Concentration values.

Additional research gaps identified include the need for monitoring efforts to focus on specific locations as part of wider spatial and investigative studies incorporating other matrices, since possible ecological impacts in biota have been investigated only to a limited degree. The use of several species for monitoring represents a confounding factor that is difficult to address, and uncertainty exists about whether present species-specific assessment criteria result in appropriate TBT indices.

The breakdown of commercial catches of the crustacean Crangon crangon in 1990/1991 was suggested to be caused by endocrine disruption from TBT. TBT-based antifouling paints caused shell chambering and poor growth in oyster stocks.

Marine gastropods, particularly the dog whelk Nucella lapillus, are among the most sensitive species to TBT. This species shows high sensitivity possibly due to bioconcentration through the food chain and high exposure in rocky shore environments. The combined effects of TBT and other contaminants on higher trophic levels like marine mammals remain poorly studied. Current TBT substitutes containing copper and zinc metals may pose ecological sustainability concerns, as antifouling paints lead to exceedance of environmental quality standards.

All indicator assessments,Trends in new records of non-indigenous species introduced by human activities,OK,p00910_nis_qsr2023,"The provided context from this OSPAR report contains only two brief mentions related to climate change. The document references the goal of achieving marine ecosystems that are ""resilient to climate change and ocean acidification"" as part of sustainable ocean management by 2020. Additionally, it notes that non-indigenous species (NIS) can alter ""species adaptive potential to environmental changes,"" which could encompass climate-related changes, though this connection is not explicitly made.

However, this OSPAR report does not contain any substantive discussion, analysis, findings, or data specifically about climate change impacts, trends, or effects in the OSPAR Maritime Area. The document focuses entirely on assessing trends in non-indigenous species introductions from 2003-2020 across three OSPAR regions. The 479 NIS records analyzed, monitoring approaches, data quality issues, and recommendations for improved NIS detection and management comprise the report's primary content.

The report examines declining trends in new NIS records over the assessment periods, taxonomic diversity of introduced species, regional variations in introductions, and methodological challenges in NIS monitoring. While climate change could potentially influence NIS introduction patterns, dispersal, or ecosystem impacts, the document does not explore these relationships or provide any climate-related analysis. The context is insufficient to answer questions about OSPAR's findings, recommendations, or perspectives on climate change, as this topic falls outside the report's scope of NIS assessment and monitoring.",,"The provided context primarily focuses on non-indigenous species (NIS) rather than direct climate change threats and pressures. However, it does reveal some relevant connections between climate change and marine pressures.

Non-indigenous species can reduce native species' adaptive potential to environmental changes, which becomes particularly significant in the context of climate-driven environmental shifts. Through competition for resources and space, as well as hybridisation with native species, invasive NIS alter population and species composition, food webs, biogeochemical cycles and water quality. These impacts create additional pressures on marine ecosystems that may already be stressed by climate change.

The context indicates that strengthening ecosystem resilience is a key management objective, with efforts focused on achieving oceans that are ""resilient to climate change and ocean acidification."" This suggests recognition that climate change and ocean acidification represent significant ongoing threats requiring active management responses.

Knowledge gaps exist around which NIS will become invasive, and there's difficulty controlling NIS spread in marine environments. This becomes more complex when considering that climate change may alter species distributions and create new opportunities for NIS establishment and spread. The focus remains on prevention of NIS introduction and early detection, which becomes increasingly important as climate change may facilitate new invasion pathways and alter ecosystem vulnerabilities.

However, the context does not provide specific data on climate change impacts, temperature changes, sea level rise, or detailed analysis of how climate pressures interact with other marine threats. The document's primary focus is on NIS monitoring and management rather than comprehensive climate change threat assessment.",,"Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about how climate change impacts species, habitats and ecosystems. The context focuses exclusively on non-indigenous species (NIS) monitoring and assessment in the OSPAR Maritime Area from 2003-2020.

The only climate-related reference appears in passing mentions of ocean resilience to climate change and ocean acidification, but no specific impacts are described.

However, the context does reveal how non-indigenous species impact marine ecosystems. Through competition for resources and space, as well as hybridisation with native species, invasive NIS alter population and species composition, reduce species adaptive potential to environmental changes, and disrupt food webs, biogeochemical cycles and water quality. These pressures pose significant threats to marine biodiversity and can have economic and health impacts.

A total of 479 records of new NIS were documented across three OSPAR regions from 2003-2020, reduced to 426 records after excluding certain species types. Most NIS occur within crustaceans, macroalgae and polychaetes, though they have been observed across most taxonomic groups, representing diverse traits, habitat requirements, trophic levels, and functions. This taxonomic diversity indicates that invaded locations cover a large range of habitats and environmental conditions.

The pathway of introduction remains uncertain for 56% of species. Major introduction vectors include ships' ballast water transfer, biofouling on ship hulls, and aquaculture trade. The assessment reveals substantial knowledge gaps in NIS dispersal patterns and ecological impacts, requiring strengthened monitoring approaches to understand future changes in marine ecosystem composition and function.",,"The provided context focuses entirely on non-indigenous species (NIS) monitoring and assessment, with no direct discussion of climate change gaps. However, the context does reveal one indirect connection: NIS can alter ""species adaptive potential to environmental changes,"" suggesting that knowledge gaps around which NIS will become invasive could impact understanding of ecosystem responses to environmental shifts.

The extensive gaps identified relate specifically to NIS monitoring and assessment. Key monitoring gaps include substantial uncertainty in spatial and temporal coverage, with only 14% of NIS records coming from dedicated government monitoring programs while 43% originate from academic surveys and 6% from citizen science. Severe time lags exist between introduction dates, first observations, and publication of reports, creating uncertainty particularly for recent data periods.

Critical knowledge gaps encompass the inability to quantify monitoring effort variations across space and time, making it impossible to distinguish between actual trends in NIS introductions versus changes in detection effort. The assessment lacks standardized protocols, coordination between contracting parties, and quality assurance systems (only 50% of data used quality assurance). Additionally, there are gaps in understanding NIS dispersal patterns and ecological impacts, with insufficient baseline datasets for future comparisons.

Methodological gaps include the absence of long-term temporal datasets from consistent monitoring programs and lack of contextual data about whether NIS observations occur in high-risk areas versus natural habitats. The current assessment cannot effectively evaluate management measure effectiveness due to these data limitations.

While climate change is not explicitly addressed in this context, the identified gaps in understanding species adaptive potential and ecosystem impacts could indirectly affect climate change vulnerability assessments.",,"The provided context does not contain specific recommendations related to climate change or climate-related research gaps.

Instead, the document extensively details recommendations for improving NIS monitoring and assessment, including developing coordinated monitoring approaches, establishing baseline datasets, improving early detection systems, standardizing protocols across regions, and testing complementary indicators for assessing NIS dispersal and impact. The research gaps identified relate specifically to monitoring effort standardization, data quality improvements, taxonomic identification accuracy, and vector-related monitoring at high-risk locations like ports and aquaculture sites.

The document acknowledges that NIS can alter species adaptive potential to environmental changes, food webs, and biogeochemical cycles, which could be relevant to climate resilience, but does not develop this connection into specific climate-related recommendations or research priorities.

The North-East Atlantic Ocean faces resilience challenges from climate change and ocean acidification, but no specific data, trends, measurements, or impacts are detailed in this document.

The context primarily focuses on underwater noise pollution assessment in the North Sea, examining continuous noise from shipping, fisheries, and windfarm development. Sound pressure levels show large spatial variations, with median levels ranging from 99 dB@1mPa² at the Danish Anholt station to 125 dB@1mPa² at the Belgium Westhinder station. In southern North Sea areas and along major shipping routes, noise levels increase by 20 to 30 dB@1mPa² above background levels. Summer months show slightly higher noise levels than other seasons.

The document acknowledges knowledge gaps regarding cumulative impacts of human activities including fisheries, shipping, and windfarm development on North Sea ecosystems, but does not connect these to climate change effects.

The document focuses entirely on underwater noise pollution as a marine environmental pressure, particularly continuous noise from human activities like shipping, offshore wind development, and other industrial activities in the North Sea.

The context discusses the effects of man-made underwater noise on marine animals, which use sound to navigate, find food, communicate, and detect threats. Continuous noise can mask these essential biological functions, with pressure indices varying across North Sea sub-regions from 0.07 in the Dogger Bank to 0.40 in the southern North Sea. The assessment identifies major knowledge gaps concerning cumulative impacts of human activities including fisheries, shipping, and windfarm development on marine ecosystems.

The document focuses entirely on underwater noise assessment in the North Sea, with knowledge gaps centered on acoustic impacts rather than climate-related issues.

The identified knowledge gaps concern underwater noise effects on marine ecosystems. Major gaps include insufficient understanding of continuous noise effects on marine life, both individual animals and populations. There is lack of knowledge about the ecological situation in an undisturbed North Sea and realistic feasible minimum ecological quality standards given human activities. Knowledge concerning cumulative impacts of human activities like fisheries, shipping and windfarm development on North Sea ecosystems is lacking.

Technical assessment gaps include the need for better acoustical properties data for noise sources, as current literature only provides statistical proxies. Models used are unsuited to very shallow water and intertidal areas. The validation process highlighted complexity and limitations in both field measurements and acoustic modelling that require improvement.

Methodological gaps exist around species selection criteria for North Sea assessments, appropriate frequency band selection for different indicator species, and subdivision criteria for regional assessments. No information on continuous noise in OSPAR Region IV and the Channel was available during assessment drafting.

The document identifies need for interdisciplinary efforts to better understand good environmental status in relation to noise, but does not connect these knowledge gaps to climate change considerations.

Instead, the context reveals extensive recommendations and research gaps related to underwater noise pollution. Major knowledge gaps identified include: effects of continuous noise on marine life at both individual and population levels; lack of understanding about cumulative impacts of human activities including fisheries, shipping and windfarm development; absence of criteria for defining ecological sub-regions; and insufficient knowledge about the ecological situation in an undisturbed North Sea.

The assessment methodology requires further validation and development through the EU MSFD process. Current models are inadequate for very shallow water (less than 10 meters depth) and intertidal areas. Additional research needs include: better description of noise source strength from various human activities; development of species distribution maps in collaboration with marine biologists; determination of appropriate frequency bands for different indicator species; and creation of habitat suitability maps focusing on spawning areas where animals are most vulnerable.

Instead, the context extensively documents how underwater noise affects marine organisms. Marine animals including whales, fish, and invertebrates rely heavily on auditory senses for navigation, finding food, communicating with partners, and detecting threats due to low underwater visibility. Man-made noise from shipping, wind farms, and oil and gas activities can disturb these essential biological functions. Noise masking reduces the listening and communication space of marine organisms by increasing environmental noise levels.

Major knowledge gaps exist concerning continuous noise effects on both individual marine animals and whole populations.

Different species show sensitivity to different frequency spectrums, with masking effects on marine mammals being best understood.

Spawning areas represent particularly vulnerable locations where animals are most susceptible to disturbance, as demonstrated with cod spawning areas during spring months.

All indicator assessments,Pilot assessment of area of habitat loss,OK,p00953_qsr2023_pilot_assessment_bh4_area_habitat_loss,"The provided context does not contain substantive information about climate change. The document is an OSPAR pilot assessment focused on habitat loss due to physical pressures from human activities such as offshore structures, bottom trawling, and aggregate extraction in the Greater North Sea.

Climate change is mentioned only twice in passing: once noting that climate change may affect the distribution of species forming biogenic habitats, and once in a brief organizational vision statement about ocean resilience to climate change and ocean acidification. However, no specific climate change impacts, data, findings, or analysis are presented.

The assessment exclusively examines habitat loss through physical mechanisms - sealed loss from offshore structures like wind turbine foundations and platforms (totaling 92 km² lost in the Greater North Sea), and unsealed loss from activities like bottom trawling that cause permanent sediment alterations lasting 12+ years. The document evaluates risk categories for different habitat types based on fishing intensity and sediment composition changes, with biogenic habitats showing the highest proportion of sealed loss and particular vulnerability to mechanical destruction.

The context is insufficient to answer questions about climate change, as this assessment focuses entirely on direct physical pressures rather than climate-related impacts on marine ecosystems.",,"Based on the provided context, climate change is mentioned only briefly as one threat among several affecting marine habitats. Climate change is identified as potentially altering the distribution of species that form biogenic habitats. Specifically, changing climate conditions may affect the spatial distribution patterns of organisms that create reef structures and other biogenic habitats in the North-East Atlantic.

The context indicates that biogenic habitats face multiple pressures beyond climate change, including bottom-trawl fisheries and other anthropogenic physical influences. These habitats are considered particularly vulnerable because they are formed by long-lived and bio-engineering species such as cold-water coral reefs and horse mussel beds, which have specific habitat requirements and extremely slow recovery rates - potentially taking several decades to recover or may not recover at all if damaged.

Biogenic habitats show the highest probability of habitat loss overall, with 52-72% of biogenic habitat area assessed as having moderate risk of loss during 2015-2020. However, the assessment focuses primarily on physical pressures from human activities such as offshore structures, bottom trawling, and aggregate extraction rather than climate-related pressures.

The document's vision statement mentions developing resilience to both climate change and ocean acidification as goals for the North-East Atlantic Ocean, but the technical assessment itself does not provide detailed analysis of climate change impacts, mechanisms, or specific climate-related threats to marine habitats.

The substantial context provided deals extensively with physical habitat loss assessment in the OSPAR Maritime Area. Key findings include that biogenic habitats face the highest risk, with 52-72% of biogenic habitat area assessed with moderate risk of loss during 2015-2020. Physical disturbance affects different habitat types variably, with mud habitats particularly at risk in the Southern North Sea, Kattegat, and Norwegian Trench, while coarse sediments are endangered in the Channel and Central North Sea. Recovery of reef-forming species is generally low due to slow growth rates, and habitat alterations can become apparent when sediment activity ratio exceeds 16.

The assessment methods focus on sealed loss from offshore structures and unsealed loss from activities like bottom trawling that cause permanent changes lasting 12+ years. However, this physical pressure assessment framework does not provide the climate change impact analysis requested in the question.",,"Based on the OSPAR report context provided, climate change is mentioned only once in relation to gaps. The report identifies that changes in the distribution of species forming biogenic habitats may be caused by climate change, specifically noting that species like cold-water corals and horse mussels may be endangered by climate change altering their distribution patterns.

However, the context focuses primarily on other types of knowledge gaps rather than climate change-specific gaps. The main gaps identified include:

Data availability gaps are extensive, with insufficient information on the distribution and intensity of human activities and habitat types. Aggregate extraction data is particularly inadequate for producing risk assessments. Large spatial gaps exist in threatened and declining habitats data due to lack of survey coverage, with no predictive modeling to fill these gaps, likely causing underestimation of habitat extent and distribution.

Methodological gaps limit the assessment scope to selected offshore structures, trawling, and aggregate extraction, excluding activities like capital dredging, sediment disposal, and coastal activities. The assessment cannot evaluate unsealed loss impacts on threatened habitat types due to considerable uncertainties in both habitat and activities data. Historic biogenic habitat loss assessment requires development of appropriate habitat suitability models and access to historical records.

Temporal gaps exist because habitat data spans many decades without accounting for changes over time, making it impossible to determine temporal habitat changes. Confidence in habitat information is assessed as low due to data entries dating back to 1900 and multiple data layers from different years for the same habitat types.

The report emphasizes that improved survey efforts, dedicated monitoring programs, and newer, more accurate data could enhance future assessments' reliability.",,"The provided context does not contain specific recommendations regarding climate change. While the context mentions one reference to climate change - noting that species distribution changes can affect biogenic habitats and that the goal is a marine ecosystem ""resilient to climate change and ocean acidification"" - it does not present any detailed climate-related recommendations or research priorities.

The context focuses primarily on habitat loss assessment methodology and data gaps related to physical pressures from human activities like offshore structures, trawling, and aggregate extraction. The recommendations and research needs identified relate to marine habitat protection and monitoring rather than climate change specifically.

Key recommendations for further investigation include: developing hydrographical models that account for severe sediment alterations to improve accuracy of impact assessments; conducting ground truthing of sites with estimated high risk of habitat alteration; evaluating sediment changes from different intensities of fishing and extraction activities; establishing comprehensive revision and alignment of habitat classifications across different areas and scientific groups; implementing dedicated monitoring programmes to improve knowledge of broad and protected habitat distribution; extending assessments to additional activities causing sealed and unsealed habitat loss across other OSPAR regions; exploring assessment of historic biogenic habitat loss; improving data availability on spatial extent and intensity of licensed activities; and developing threshold values for habitat loss indicators that align with Marine Strategy Framework Directive recommendations.

The context consists entirely of technical findings from a habitat loss assessment focused on physical pressures in the Greater North Sea region.

The available context addresses habitat loss through physical pressures such as sealed loss from offshore structures (wind turbine foundations, platforms), unsealed loss from bottom trawling and aggregate extraction, and sediment alterations. Recovery of reef structures affected by physical damage may take several decades or may not occur at all. Biogenic habitats face the highest probability of loss, with 52-72% of biogenic habitat area assessed at moderate risk during 2015-2020, as these structures suffer severe damage even at low fishing intensities. Cold-water coral reefs, horse mussel beds, and other biogenic habitats defined by long-lived bio-engineering species are of particular concern for habitat loss.

The assessment found that in the Greater North Sea, 14.7% and 14.1% of the Channel and Southern North Sea respectively face low to high risk categories for habitat loss. Biogenic habitats are particularly endangered in the Channel, Southern and Central North Sea regions.

All indicator assessments,Pilot Assessment of ecological network analysis indices,OK,p00952_qsr2023_fw9_pilot_assessment,"The provided context contains limited direct discussion of climate change. The report mentions climate change only briefly in two specific contexts.

Climate change appears as one of several pressures affecting marine ecosystems, mentioned alongside marine renewable energy as cumulative impacts that Ecological Network Analysis indices can assess. Additionally, the document references climate change in the context of ecosystem resilience, noting that certain indices have shown sensitivity to persistent ecosystem changes such as overfishing combined with temperature fluctuations.

However, the report does not provide specific findings, data, or detailed analysis about climate change impacts on marine food webs or ecosystems. The focus remains primarily on food web structure and functioning analysis through Ecological Network Analysis indices across different OSPAR regions between 1997-2019.

The document does reveal significant changes in primary production across multiple regions and timeframes that could be climate-related, though climate change is not explicitly identified as the driver. Primary production decreased from 2009 until 2014 but increased since 2015 in the Elbe Plume region, with several trophic guilds closely linked to these changes in primary production and phytoplankton biomass. In the Kattegat region, phytoplankton production showed highest values in 2011, and various ecological indices tracked these primary production changes over time.

The assessment identifies ecosystem resilience changes, with the relative overhead indicator significantly decreasing over time in some regions, suggesting decreasing ecosystem resilience. While this could relate to climate impacts, the report does not make this connection explicit.

The context primarily addresses food web assessment methodology rather than climate change impacts specifically.",,"Based on the provided context, climate change threats and pressures are mentioned only indirectly through temperature fluctuations and their ecosystem impacts. The Ecological Network Analysis indices demonstrate sensitivity to persistent ecosystem changes including ""overfishing combined with impacts such as temperature fluctuations."" These temperature fluctuations, when combined with fishing pressure, affect food web structure and functioning.

The analysis reveals that ecosystem resilience is decreasing in some areas. In the Azores region, the relative overhead indicator significantly decreased over time between 1997-2018, suggesting declining ecosystem resilience. The lowest values of this resilience indicator occurred under the combined cumulative effects of high fishing pressure and lowest levels of primary production.

Primary production variability strongly influences food web dynamics across multiple regions. In coastal areas of OSPAR Region II (Bay of Seine, Elbe Plume), several trophic guilds showed strong linkages to changes in primary production and phytoplankton biomass over time. The detritivory over herbivory ratio and Finn Cycling index exhibited similar trends to primary production dynamics.

Flow-based ecological indicators proved particularly sensitive to perturbations affecting total production or biomass at the system level. The analysis identified that changes in primary production anomalies drive indicator trajectories, with different models predicting the lowest resilience values occurred between 2008-2012 when production was most constrained.

However, the context lacks comprehensive information about specific climate change pressures such as ocean acidification, sea level rise, or direct temperature impacts beyond these brief mentions of temperature fluctuations affecting ecosystem changes.",,"The provided context does not specifically address how climate change impacts species, habitats and ecosystems. The document focuses primarily on Ecological Network Analysis (ENA) indices used to assess food web structure and functioning in OSPAR marine regions, rather than climate change impacts.

However, the context does reveal some relevant findings about ecosystem changes and pressures. Temporal changes in food web structure and functioning were identified across OSPAR Regions II and V, with several trophic guilds closely linked to changes in primary production and phytoplankton biomass over time. In coastal areas, primary production decreased from 2009 until 2014 but increased since 2015, accompanied by increases in biomass of benthic filter feeding invertebrates and benthic feeding birds that likely benefited from this change.

The analysis demonstrates ecosystem sensitivity to multiple pressures, with ENA indices successfully evaluating consequences of changes in food web structure due to different pressures including fisheries and temperature fluctuations. In the Azores deep-sea ecosystem, dynamics are highly influenced by bottom-up processes at the primary producer level, with ecosystem resilience decreasing over time as indicated by declining relative overhead indicators.

The document shows that ecosystems exhibit complex responses across different trophic levels, from primary producers through plankton to top predators including fish, birds and mammals. Changes occurred in different food web components - pelagic structures in the Bay of Seine versus benthic trophic guilds in the Elbe Plume. However, specific climate change mechanisms and their direct impacts on species, habitats and ecosystems are not detailed in this technical assessment of food web analysis methodologies.",,"The OSPAR report identifies several critical gaps related to understanding climate change impacts on marine food webs, though climate change is primarily addressed through its interactions with other stressors rather than as a standalone issue.

The most significant gap involves pressure-state relationships for cumulative effects. The analysis reveals insufficient understanding of how various anthropogenic stressors, including climate-related pressures like temperature fluctuations, interact with other factors such as overfishing. Two major investigative steps are needed: studying pressure effects on Ecological Network Analysis indices separately, and examining them under multi-pressure conditions to understand cumulative effects.

Temperature fluctuations combined with overfishing have been shown to cause persistent ecosystem changes, with the Relative Overhead indicator demonstrating sensitivity to these combined impacts. However, appropriate baselines and threshold values for climate-related assessments remain undefined, representing a fundamental knowledge gap.

Temporal resolution inconsistencies create additional challenges for climate change analysis. Primary production data used across different assessments varies in temporal resolution (monthly versus yearly), which can lead to different conclusions about climate impacts on food web dynamics.

The assessment identifies missing ecosystem components crucial for understanding climate responses, particularly biomass data on organisms smaller than 1mm (meiofauna, bacteria) that serve as essential food resources. These components are not regularly monitored despite their importance in food web responses to environmental changes.

Spatial coverage remains inadequate, with existing food web and ecosystem models needing expansion to capture climate change effects across all OSPAR regions. The current assessment covers only limited areas in Regions II and V, leaving substantial geographical gaps in understanding climate impacts on marine food webs throughout the North-East Atlantic.",,"Based on the provided OSPAR report context, the recommendations regarding climate change are limited, as this document focuses primarily on Ecological Network Analysis (ENA) indices for food web assessment rather than comprehensive climate change recommendations.

The only direct climate change reference indicates that ENA indices have been shown as sensitive to persistent ecosystem changes including temperature fluctuations combined with overfishing impacts. The Relative Overhead index specifically demonstrates sensitivity to these temperature-related changes.

Regarding research needs that could relate to climate impacts, several key areas require further investigation:

Pressure-state relationships need development to understand how various cumulative anthropogenic stressors (which would include climate-related pressures) affect food web structure and functioning. Two major research steps are identified: studying pressure effects on ENA indices separately, and examining multi-pressure conditions including cumulative effects.

Appropriate baselines and threshold values for food web indicators require evaluation. The assessment calls for investigating commonalities in how different stressors influence food web indices to better define assessment thresholds.

Primary production dynamics strongly influence food web indicator trajectories, and the report notes that relative overhead indicator values are particularly affected by primary production availability. Since climate change affects primary production patterns, this represents an important research area.

Uncertainty analysis and replicate modeling are necessary to assess temporal and spatial variability in food web responses. Statistical significance testing between different index values also requires development.

The context primarily addresses technical aspects of food web modeling rather than comprehensive climate change adaptation or mitigation strategies. The climate-related recommendations focus on improving understanding of how temperature fluctuations and other environmental changes affect marine food web structure and functioning.",,"Based on the provided context from this OSPAR report, there is extremely limited information about ocean acidification. The report focuses entirely on food web structure and functioning using Ecological Network Analysis indices across different marine ecosystems in OSPAR Regions II and V.

Ocean acidification is mentioned only twice in organizational vision statements, which are not substantive scientific findings. The context contains no actual data, measurements, trends, impacts, or analysis related to ocean acidification in the North-East Atlantic Ocean.

The report extensively covers food web dynamics, including temporal changes in primary production, phytoplankton biomass, trophic guild relationships, and ecosystem resilience indicators. Carbon flows are discussed throughout, but only in the context of trophic interactions within food webs - such as carbon import as potential resources for food web species growth and carbon dioxide from respiration serving as resources for primary producers. However, these carbon discussions are unrelated to ocean acidification processes.

Several ecological indicators showed temporal trends, including decreasing relative overhead indicators in the Azores deep-sea ecosystem, suggesting declining ecosystem resilience. Primary production variations were documented across different regions and time periods, with some areas showing increases since 2015 and others showing decreases from 2009-2014. The report identifies knowledge gaps regarding pressure-state relationships and threshold values for various anthropogenic stressors, but ocean acidification is not specifically addressed as a stressor requiring investigation.

The available context is insufficient to provide any meaningful analysis of ocean acidification findings, as this topic is not covered in the technical content of this particular OSPAR report section.",,"Based on the provided context, this OSPAR report does not contain specific information about how ocean acidification impacts species, habitats and ecosystems. The context consists entirely of technical details about food web modeling, Ecological Network Analysis indices, and temporal changes in marine food webs across OSPAR Regions II and V.

The report focuses on assessing food web structure and functioning through analysis of trophic interactions among marine species including primary producers, plankton, benthic invertebrates, fish, birds, and marine mammals. It examines temporal changes in biomass distribution across different trophic guilds, primary production patterns, and ecosystem organization between 2000-2019 across various marine areas including the Bay of Seine, Elbe Plume, Kattegat, and Azores regions.

While ocean acidification is mentioned twice in organizational vision statements as a pressure that marine ecosystems should be ""resilient to,"" no scientific findings, data, or analysis regarding ocean acidification's specific effects on marine life are presented in this context. The report instead concentrates on evaluating pressures such as fisheries impacts on food web dynamics and the relationships between primary production changes and various trophic groups.

The document identifies knowledge gaps in food web assessment methodologies, including needs for better biomass data on small organisms, harmonization of functional groups, and improved understanding of pressure-state relationships, but does not address ocean acidification impacts specifically.

All indicator assessments,Pilot assessment of feeding guilds,OK,p00856_pilot_assessment_feeding_guild_qsr23,"High predator-prey mass ratio (PPMR) interactions can help mitigate perturbations from climate change among other stressors because they dampen strong oscillatory dynamics and help maintain stability in food webs and ecosystem functioning. Species distributions, body size, and interactions are changing in response to fishing and climate change, making this particularly pertinent for understanding and managing human impacts on marine ecosystems.

Marine ecosystems face changes in species composition driven by climate change, which can be the biggest driver of change in community-wide PPMR since these estimates show significant inter-species variation due to differing foraging strategies. Systematic change in predators with relatively high PPMRs in response to anthropogenic pressure would be useful to detect to better understand how changes in feeding guilds may affect ecosystem functioning.

The analysis reveals spatial and temporal changes in feeding guild responses across the OSPAR Maritime Area from 1997-2020. Planktivore biomass showed declines in the Celtic Sea, Bay of Biscay and north-western North Sea, with increases in the English Channel, Bristol Channel, along the northwestern coast of Spain and in the northwest study region. Pisco-crustivore and piscivore biomasses, representing higher trophic levels, increased in Celtic Seas and Bay of Biscay regions, while their biomass and species richness generally increased moving west and north across the study area.

These changes demonstrate both structural and functional alterations in food webs as the relative importance of different energy pathways shifts, with systematic differences in responses between smaller organisms feeding lower in the food web versus larger-bodied organisms utilizing different resources at higher trophic levels.",,"The report identifies climate change as a significant pressure causing observable changes in marine ecosystems. Species distributions, body size, and ecological interactions are changing in response to climate change alongside fishing pressures. These changes are documented to continue occurring, with projections indicating they will persist worldwide.

Climate change acts as a perturbation that disrupts marine food web stability and functioning. However, high predator-prey mass ratio (PPMR) interactions help mitigate these perturbations by dampening strong oscillatory dynamics in food webs. When species composition changes due to climate pressures, it becomes the primary driver of changes in community-wide PPMR values, which affects ecosystem functioning.

The report documents specific regional changes occurring between 1997-2020 that reflect ecosystem responses to environmental pressures including climate change. Planktivore biomass declined in the Celtic Sea, Bay of Biscay, and north-western North Sea, while increasing in the English Channel and along the northwestern Spanish coast. Changes in feeding guild biomass and species richness demonstrate alterations in food web structure and functioning, with shifts in the relative importance of different energy pathways.

Climate change pressure is particularly problematic for understanding marine ecosystem impacts because it alters fundamental ecological relationships - affecting not just individual species but the complex predator-prey interactions that determine food web structure. The systematic differences in how smaller planktivorous organisms respond compared to larger benthivorous and piscivorous species can profoundly alter nutrient uptake efficiency and biomass conversion processes that support ecosystem services. The report notes that feeding guild responses to environmental and anthropogenic pressures, including climate change, require further research to fully understand ecosystem-wide impacts.",,"Climate change impacts marine species distributions, body size, and ecological interactions, driving profound ecosystem-level changes across the OSPAR Maritime Area. Species distributions are shifting in response to climate change alongside fishing pressures, with these changes projected to continue worldwide. Body size changes are occurring as smaller-bodied organisms feeding lower in food webs (planktivores) respond differently compared to larger-bodied species that utilize different resources and feed higher up (benthivores, pisco-crustivores, piscivores).

These differential responses alter both food web structure and functioning by changing the distribution of biomass and species across feeding guilds and modifying the relative importance of different energy pathways. Such changes profoundly affect nutrient uptake and the efficiency of communities in converting resources into biomass, ultimately impacting ecosystem functioning that supports ecosystem services provision.

High predator-prey mass ratio interactions help maintain food web stability and ecosystem functioning by dampening strong oscillatory dynamics, enabling these interactions to mitigate perturbations from climate change among other stressors. However, species composition changes can be the biggest driver of community-wide predator-prey ratio changes due to differing foraging strategies.

Survey data from 1997-2020 reveals spatially structured temporal changes in feeding guild responses across the Northeast Atlantic. Planktivore biomass showed declines in the Celtic Sea, Bay of Biscay and northwestern North Sea, while piscivore and pisco-crustivore biomass increased in Celtic Seas and Bay of Biscay regions. These contrasting patterns demonstrate ongoing ecosystem restructuring, with changes in functional redundancy as feeding guild species richness varies regionally, indicating altered ecosystem resilience to environmental pressures.",,"The OSPAR report identifies several critical gaps in understanding climate change impacts on marine food webs. A fundamental knowledge gap exists regarding feeding guild responses to environmental and anthropogenic pressures, including climate change, which were not considered in this assessment but will be addressed in future work. This represents a significant limitation in current understanding of how climate change affects marine ecosystem functioning.

The report highlights that insufficient stomach contents data prevents classification of many taxa size classes observed in surveys into feeding guilds. Maps and tables identify where unclassified biomass and species are most prominent, directing future stomach sampling toward currently under-sampled predators and areas. This data gap is particularly problematic because understanding dietary changes through species maturity requires large numbers of observations, yet this information is essential for managing climate change impacts on marine ecosystems.

Climate change is fundamentally altering species distributions, body sizes, and ecosystem interactions, with changes projected to continue worldwide. However, the assessment methodology faces temporal constraints - longer time-series exist for some surveys but cannot be included because this would create inconsistent temporal scales across regions, potentially confounding interpretation of climate-related changes.

The knock-on effects of feeding guild changes across assemblages (plankton, benthos, top-predators) require further research. Additionally, pelagic fish species and juvenile fish are under-sampled using current trawl methods. While acoustic methods and catchability corrections could address these sampling issues, they have not yet been applied at the OSPAR area scale.

These gaps collectively limit the ability to fully understand and predict how climate change will affect marine food web structure and ecosystem functioning across the North-East Atlantic.",,"Based on the provided context, the document contains limited explicit recommendations regarding climate change action. However, it does identify key research priorities and management approaches related to climate impacts on marine ecosystems.

The primary recommendation focuses on strengthening ecosystem resilience through sustainable management and protection of marine ecosystems to achieve healthy and productive oceans that are resilient to climate change and ocean acidification. The document emphasizes targeted actions for protection and conservation of species, habitats, and ecosystem processes.

Several critical research gaps requiring investigation are identified. Species distributions, body size, and ecological interactions are changing in response to climate change, yet systematic understanding of these impacts remains insufficient. The document notes that feeding guild responses to environmental and anthropogenic pressures, including climate change, require further research. Specifically, the knock-on effects of feeding guild changes across assemblages (plankton, benthos, top-predators) need additional investigation.

The research reveals that high predator-prey mass ratio (PPMR) interactions help mitigate perturbations from climate change by dampening strong oscillatory dynamics and maintaining food web stability. However, change in species composition can be the biggest driver of community-wide PPMR changes, indicating that climate-induced species shifts could significantly alter ecosystem functioning.

Food web indicators are identified as essential tools for revealing how ecosystems respond to environmental change and climate pressure in ways that cannot be inferred from studying individual habitat, species, or assemblages alone. The document demonstrates that contrasting changes in feeding guild biomasses and species richness indicate both structural and functional changes in marine food webs, with altered energy pathways affecting ecosystem services provision.

The document provided focuses entirely on a pilot assessment of feeding guilds in marine ecosystems, analyzing changes in fish feeding patterns, biomass distributions, and species richness across the OSPAR Maritime Area from 1997-2020. The assessment examines how different feeding guilds (planktivores, benthivores, pisco-crustivores, and piscivores) respond to environmental pressures and how these changes affect ecosystem structure and functioning.

While the document extensively discusses climate change impacts on marine ecosystems, including how species distributions, body size, and interactions are changing in response to environmental pressures, it does not provide any specific data, findings, analysis, or recommendations regarding ocean acidification itself.

Spatially extensive declines in planktivore biomass occurred in North Sea and Bay of Biscay subdivisions, while biomass of higher trophic level feeding guilds (pisco-crustivores and piscivores) increased in Celtic Seas and Bay of Biscay regions. These contrasting changes demonstrate alterations in food web structure and functioning, affecting nutrient uptake and community efficiency in converting resources to biomass.

The research identifies that species distributions, body size, and interactions are changing in response to fishing and climate change, with changes projected to continue worldwide.

The methodology accounts for various covariates including weather conditions in different years, but no specific climate change impacts or findings are discussed.

The assessment reveals mixed population trends among marine bird species: red-throated divers and northern gannets showed significant declines in the last six years, while common guillemot winter populations increased significantly. Northern gannets and common guillemots increased approximately threefold compared to baseline periods, black-legged kittiwakes increased by 30%, and red-throated divers decreased by 9% but still achieved threshold values.

The context primarily focuses on a pilot assessment of marine bird abundance for non-breeding offshore birds in the North Sea from 1991-2020. While the document presents detailed findings on bird population trends, it does not explicitly connect these trends to climate change pressures. The assessment found that northern gannets and common guillemots increased about threefold compared to baseline periods, black-legged kittiwakes increased by 30%, and red-throated divers achieved threshold values despite decreasing by 9%. Significant declines in the last six years were recorded for red-throated diver and northern gannet, while common guillemot populations were increasing significantly.

The document mentions that species assessments use threshold values designed to reflect different species' resilience to population declines, and when relative abundance falls below these thresholds, it indicates ""poor"" status requiring further research or management.

The population changes documented could potentially be related to climate effects, but no causal relationships or climate impact mechanisms are discussed in the available material.",,"Based on the provided context, the document identifies several knowledge gaps related to monitoring marine birds, though it does not specifically discuss climate change gaps in detail.

The primary knowledge gap concerns spatial coverage limitations for marine bird monitoring. Monitoring is currently conducted by several Contracting Parties, mostly within their territorial waters and Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZ). While this will enable assessments for future status reports with expanded marine area coverage compared to the current pilot assessment, the vast expanse of the North-East Atlantic creates significant coverage challenges for ship-based and aerial surveys due to logistical and financial constraints.

The report identifies that comprehensive coverage through traditional survey methods is impeded by the substantial logistical and financial effort required for such extensive surveys across the North-East Atlantic. To address these gaps, the document suggests that surveys focusing on representative sub-samples rather than attempting complete overview coverage, combined with advances in predictive modelling, could help increase assessment effectiveness.

The assessment was restricted to selected species for financial and capacity reasons, even though sufficient data existed to assess all species wintering at sea in the Southern North Sea. This represents another knowledge gap where fuller species coverage could be achieved with adequate resources.

A worldwide assessment identified marine birds as facing three major threats: predation by invasive alien species, by-catch in fisheries, and climate change/severe weather. Among these three threats, by-catch was found to have the greatest average impact on marine bird populations, according to research by Dias et al. (2019).

The context does not provide any specific data, findings, or detailed analysis regarding climate change impacts on marine ecosystems or bird populations in the OSPAR Maritime Area. No temperature changes, oceanographic shifts, habitat alterations, or climate-related population effects are documented in the available passages.

The context identifies climate change and severe weather as one of three major threats facing marine birds globally, alongside predation by invasive alien species and fisheries by-catch. However, by-catch has the greatest average impact among these threats according to worldwide assessments.

The context provides one specific example of climate change effects: Steller's eider populations wintering in Europe have experienced prolonged declines, raising conservation concerns for the Western Palearctic population. This Arctic species breeds along the Arctic coasts of Siberia and Alaska and migrates to near-Arctic waters in winter. In the 1990s, up to 13,200 Steller's eiders were counted in Norway's Varangerfjord, but during recent decades there has been a distributional shift with birds now primarily residing in Russia.

The context emphasizes the need to strengthen ecosystem resilience and restore marine and coastal ecosystems to avoid significant adverse impacts, indicating that building adaptive capacity is crucial for ecosystem health. Population viability analyses demonstrate that marine bird populations are highly sensitive to small variations in adult survival, with demographic modeling showing that even 1%, 5%, or 10% increases in mortality can significantly impact population dynamics over three-generation periods.

The extensive gaps discussed throughout these reports relate entirely to by-catch monitoring and assessment capabilities. By-catch data for marine birds are lacking considerably across the entire OSPAR Maritime Area due to very few dedicated monitoring programmes. Significant gaps exist concerning limited data and overall poor spatial coverage, resulting in low confidence in data coverage. A long-lasting and persisting data deficiency affects most species across most parts of the OSPAR Maritime Area, with relevant fishing effort data still unavailable or of insufficient quality.

These data gaps severely constrain assessment capabilities - where by-catch data or population size data are unavailable, species must be classified as 'Not Assessed'. The assessment methods developed specifically for this evaluation have not been used in previously published assessments and require further development, contributing to low confidence in methodology.

Information is often lacking for small-scale and recreational fisheries where marine bird by-catch risk can be locally high. Only a few academic case studies, national observer programmes, and Data Collection Framework monitoring provide available by-catch data. This persistently poor data situation significantly hinders assessment of the by-catch problem and makes planning and applying specifically tailored management measures difficult.

Sea surface temperature emerges as a key environmental factor affecting marine bird distributions in the Southern North Sea. The analysis examined three variants of sea surface temperature: absolute values measured, deviations from multiannual means, and spatial gradients indicating hydrographic fronts. Data spanning 2006-2020 from MODIS satellite observations showed that sea surface temperature variables, along with Chlorophyll A concentration, significantly explained the spatio-temporal abundance patterns of all seven marine bird species examined during winter periods.

The spatio-temporal abundance of marine birds was partly explained by variables related to sea surface temperature, including its deviation from multiannual means and the occurrence of small-scale spatial gradients. These temperature variables serve as proxies for marine productivity and feeding conditions, though they do not directly reflect food abundance and availability for marine birds.

Significant relationships were detected between sea surface temperature parameters and bird abundance patterns, indicating these variables play important roles in describing marine bird distributions. The analysis incorporated interaction terms between temperature variables and distance to coast, though straightforward interpretation of regression terms was complicated by these interactions and the parallel consideration of multiple food-related variables.

Temperature deviations from long-term averages and spatial temperature gradients served as indicators of changing environmental conditions affecting bird distribution and feeding opportunities.

Chlorophyll A concentration, used as a proxy for marine productivity and food availability, also significantly explained spatio-temporal bird abundance patterns. Both chlorophyll levels and sea surface temperature variables correlated with bird densities across all seven examined species in the Southern North Sea, indicating these environmental parameters play important roles in determining habitat quality.

The analysis treated these environmental variables alongside human disturbance factors like offshore wind farms and shipping traffic. While the context acknowledges ocean acidification as a future challenge requiring ecosystem resilience, the assessment primarily examined immediate human pressures rather than climate change impacts directly.

The study period covered 1991-2020 winter data, providing a 30-year baseline for detecting environmental changes. Temperature and productivity variations during this period influenced bird habitat conditions, though the analysis did not explicitly quantify long-term climate trends or project future climate impacts on marine bird populations.

The assessment methodology could potentially detect climate-driven habitat changes through its environmental variable analysis, but the current focus remained on quantifying human activity disturbances rather than climate change pressures specifically.",,"Based on the provided context, there is no direct information about how climate change impacts species, habitats and ecosystems. The document focuses specifically on a pilot assessment of marine bird habitat quality in the Southern North Sea, examining human disturbance effects rather than climate change impacts.

The available context reveals that environmental variables including sea surface temperature and Chlorophyll A concentration significantly influence marine bird abundance and distribution patterns. Sea surface temperature variations - including absolute values, deviations from multiannual means, and spatial gradients - partially explain spatio-temporal abundance patterns of seven marine bird species examined in winter. These temperature variables serve as proxies for marine productivity and feeding conditions, indicating habitat quality for seabirds.

The assessment demonstrates that both environmental factors and human disturbances (offshore wind farms, shipping, bottom-trawling) affect marine bird distribution. Three marine bird species showed highly significant negative effects from offshore wind farms, while bottom-trawling fishery showed no negative effects on winter abundance patterns. Environmental variables like temperature gradients may indicate hydrographic fronts important for marine productivity.

Seabed habitat disturbance from activities like aggregate extraction and bottom trawling affects marine birds that feed on benthic prey or demersal fish species. Different bird species show varying responses to environmental conditions and disturbances, with some avoiding areas of concern while others adapt differently.

However, the context lacks specific information about climate change impacts on temperature regimes, ecosystem shifts, species range changes, or habitat modifications that would directly answer the question posed. The document addresses current environmental conditions as explanatory variables for bird distribution rather than examining climate-driven changes to marine ecosystems.",,"The provided context mentions climate-related variables but does not explicitly discuss gaps in relation to climate change. However, several methodological and data gaps are evident from the marine bird habitat quality assessment.

The analysis used sea surface temperature variables (absolute values, deviations from multiannual means, and spatial gradients) and Chlorophyll A concentration as proxies for marine productivity and feeding conditions. These environmental variables partly explained spatio-temporal bird abundance across six marine bird species in the southern North Sea during winter (2006-2020). The study acknowledged that these proxies ""do not exactly reflect the abundance and availability of food for marine birds"" but were used as indicators of productivity in the marine environment.

A significant methodological gap emerged with the common scoter, where the analytical approach failed due to the species' restricted distribution in shallow coastal waters with limited variation in the environmental variables used. This represents a clear limitation in applying the assessment method across different species with varying habitat preferences.

The assessment confidence was rated as moderate to low for methodology, despite being based on peer-reviewed approaches, while data coverage confidence was high for the spatial area examined. The study integrated environmental covariates including temperature-related variables but was limited to winter periods in a specific North Sea region.

No threshold values were defined for the candidate indicator, and species integration across groups was not attempted due to the limited number of assessed species. While the context establishes that environmental variables including temperature significantly influence marine bird distribution, it does not specifically identify climate change knowledge gaps or discuss climate-related research needs.",,"The provided context does not contain specific recommendations regarding climate change actions, further investigations, or research needs. The context primarily focuses on a pilot assessment of marine bird habitat quality in the Southern North Sea, examining how human activities affect bird populations.

The only climate-related content present addresses methodological approaches rather than recommendations. The assessment incorporates sea surface temperature as an environmental variable, using absolute values, deviations from multiannual means, and spatial gradients as proxies for marine productivity and feeding conditions. Chlorophyll A concentration and sea surface temperature explained spatio-temporal abundance patterns of seven marine bird species examined, with significant relationships indicating these variables play important roles in describing bird abundance patterns.

The study identifies knowledge gaps requiring further investigation, but these relate to methodological refinements rather than climate research. Specifically, some analysis outcomes are not straightforward to explain, requiring careful analysis and potential adaptation and refinement of methods. The methodology confidence is rated as moderate to low, though data coverage confidence is high.

The assessment focuses on human pressure variables including offshore wind farms, shipping densities, and bottom-trawling intensities. Three out of seven species showed highly significant negative effects from offshore wind farms, and four species responded negatively to ship presence, while bottom-trawling showed no negative effects on winter abundance patterns.

The context lacks explicit climate change recommendations, adaptation strategies, or climate research priorities that would directly address the question posed.",,"Based on the provided context, there is extremely limited information about ocean acidification.

The report focuses entirely on marine bird habitat quality assessment in the Southern North Sea, examining how environmental variables and human activities affect the spatial and temporal abundance of seven marine bird species during winter periods from 2006-2020. The environmental variables studied include chlorophyll A concentration and sea surface temperature (measured as absolute values, deviations from multiannual means, and spatial gradients), which serve as proxies for marine productivity and feeding conditions for birds.

The analysis found that both environmental variables and human disturbances (shipping, offshore wind farms, and bottom-trawling fishing) explained bird abundance patterns. Significant negative effects were detected from shipping and offshore wind farms on species like red-throated diver, northern gannet, and common guillemot. The methodology used species-distribution generalized additive models to compare current conditions with predicted undisturbed scenarios.

The assessment analyzed relationships between bird abundance and environmental variables including chlorophyll A concentration and sea surface temperature, which serve as proxies for marine productivity and feeding conditions. Findings show that both environmental variables and human disturbance activities explained spatio-temporal abundance patterns of six out of seven examined species. Visual disturbance from offshore activities affects different species across varying geographic areas, with coastal species like red-throated divers experiencing disturbance primarily in the Netherlands-Belgium coastal strip, while more widely distributed species face impacts in southwestern or western portions of the assessment area.

The study found that aggregate extraction and bottom-trawling fishing disturb or destroy seabed habitats, consequently affecting marine birds that feed on benthic prey or demersal fish species. However, fisheries can have positive effects for some bird species through discarded fish as food resources.

However, the report does not provide specific findings about climate change impacts on marine ecosystems. The main focus is on analyzing mean maximum length of fish species as an indicator of ecosystem health, with detailed assessments showing mixed patterns across different regions - increases in some areas like the Irish Sea and Bristol Channel, decreases in others such as southern areas of the Iberian Coast, and variable patterns with no clear trends in northern North Sea subdivisions.

The report identifies that ""the main causes for the observed spatial and temporal patterns in the mean maximum length indicator are not yet known,"" indicating that while changes in fish community composition are documented, the underlying drivers - whether climate change, fishing pressure, or other factors - have not been determined.

The context reveals significant changes in fish communities, including declines in large-bodied species that could compromise foodweb functioning and potentially result in local or regional extinctions. These changes occurred primarily before 1990 in central and southern North Sea subdivisions, with some areas showing stabilization at low values in recent years.

The document mentions climate change only in reference to achieving marine ecosystems that are ""resilient to climate change and ocean acidification,"" but provides no detailed analysis of climate-related threats themselves.

The context primarily focuses on fishing pressures and their impacts on fish communities. Large-bodied fish species that grow to maximum lengths are identified as particularly vulnerable to size-selective pressures like fishing because they reproduce late and remain exposed to these pressures longer. These species, typically occupying higher trophic levels as piscivores, decline first when pressure is high. The analysis shows that depending on pressure magnitude and duration, this can result in local or regional extinction of large-bodied species, compromising foodweb functioning and decreasing biodiversity.

The context reveals that large-bodied fish species are particularly vulnerable to pressures because they reproduce late and are exposed longer to size-selective pressures like fishing compared to other species. These species are expected to decline first when pressure is high. A decline in mean maximum length indicates that abundance of the most vulnerable large-bodied fish and elasmobranch species is decreasing, compromising foodweb functioning through loss of mostly piscivorous species. Depending on pressure magnitude and duration, this may result in local or regional extinction of large-bodied species and decreased biodiversity.

The analysis shows mixed regional patterns across the North-East Atlantic: increases were found in the Irish Sea and Bristol Channel, while decreases occurred in deep waters west of Scotland and Ireland, followed by partial recovery. In the Bay of Biscay and Iberian Coast, decreases were evident in southern areas with increases in the Bay of Biscay. The Greater North Sea showed long-term increases in the eastern English Channel.

The document notes that foodweb functioning is affected because larger-bodied species usually occupy higher trophic levels and are mostly piscivorous above certain sizes.

Instead, the context focuses entirely on fish community assessment through mean maximum length indicators, examining fishing pressure effects on marine fish populations across the North-East Atlantic regions.

The context demonstrates how large-bodied fish and elasmobranch species decline under size-selective pressures, with foodweb functioning becoming compromised through the loss of mostly piscivorous species. Large-bodied species that mature at relatively large sizes are more vulnerable because they reproduce late and are exposed longer to mortality pressures. Declines in mean maximum length indicate decreasing abundance of vulnerable large-bodied species, potentially resulting in local or regional extinction and decreased biodiversity depending on pressure magnitude and duration.

Regional trends show mixed outcomes: the Greater North Sea exhibits further decreases in southeastern areas during the early 2000s, while increases occurred in the Irish Sea and Bristol Channel. Celtic Seas show mixed patterns with increases in some areas but decreases in deep waters west of Scotland and Ireland. The Bay of Biscay shows increases except in deeper waters, while southern Iberian Coast areas show decreases.

The assessment reveals that larger-bodied species typically occupy higher trophic levels and are mostly piscivorous above certain sizes, making their loss significant for foodweb functioning.

All indicator assessments,Pilot assessment of primary productivity,OK,p00950_fw2_primary_productivity_qsr2023,"Climate change emerges as a significant pressure affecting phytoplankton primary production across OSPAR maritime areas. Changes in primary production linked to climate change are classified as indicators of ""not good"" quality status. Phytoplankton primary production serves as a highly sensitive indicator responding to multiple pressures including climate change alongside nutrient enrichment, light availability, contaminants, and hydrodynamics.

Climate change has been evidenced as the cause of decreasing wind speed, which relates to primary production decrease in shelf habitats of the Bay of Biscay and Iberian Coast. In this region, changes in primary production were strongly linked to climatic pressures overall. Surface warming was identified as the most important pressure linked to decline of primary production at broad scale in coastal habitats.

In Celtic Seas shelf habitats, primary production reduction was linked to decreasing mixed layer depth, probably related to increasing stratification and surface warming. Links between primary production and pressures under climate change were evident in the Celtic Seas and Bay of Biscay and Iberian Coast, as well as in coastal habitats of the Greater North Sea.

Climate indices including Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation and North Atlantic Oscillation were incorporated as environmental variables in the analysis. The assessment recognizes that phytoplankton can respond and acclimate their productivity in response to both natural and human-induced pressures, with climate change representing one of the key anthropogenic pressures affecting marine primary production. These climate-related changes in primary production can potentially disrupt higher trophic levels in marine food webs.",,"Climate change emerges as a significant pressure affecting marine primary production across multiple OSPAR regions through various mechanisms. Climate change has been evidenced as the cause of decreasing wind speed, which contributes to reduced primary production in shelf habitats. Surface warming represents the most important climate-related pressure linked to declining primary production in coastal habitats at broad scale.

In shelf habitats, primary production reduction is linked to decreasing mixed layer depth, probably related to increasing stratification and surface warming. The Bay of Biscay and Iberian Coast shows changes in primary production strongly linked to climatic pressures, with decreasing wind speed and increasing light attenuation associated with downward trends in production.

Specific climate impacts vary regionally. In the Greater North Sea, sinking mixed layer depth (16%), increasing sea surface temperature (13%), decreasing pH (13%), and decreasing wind speed (11%) rank among the most important variables linked to decreased primary production. Climate change and decreasing pH have been linked with indicators within coastal habitats of the Greater North Sea, within variable salinity, coastal and shelf habitats of the Celtic Seas, and within shelf and oceanic habitats of the Bay of Biscay and Iberian Coast.

Links between primary production and climate change pressures are evident in the Celtic Seas and Bay of Biscay regions, as well as in coastal habitats of the Greater North Sea. Quality status assessments explicitly consider indicator changes linked to increasing impacts of anthropogenic pressures, including climate change, with such changes classified as ""Not good"" status. However, ascribing changes in phytoplankton primary production directly to anthropogenic pressures remains difficult due to the complex interactions involved.",,"Climate change impacts marine ecosystems primarily through alterations to phytoplankton primary production, which forms the foundation of marine food webs. Multiple climate-related pressures drive decreasing primary production across OSPAR regions. Sinking mixed layer depth (16%), increasing sea surface temperature (13%), decreasing pH (13%), and decreasing wind speed (11%) are the most important variables linked to primary production decline, with decreased salinity (8%), precipitation (5%), and light attenuation (3%) also contributing significantly.

In coastal habitats, surface warming represents the most important pressure causing broad-scale primary production decline. Ocean acidification particularly affects the Celtic Seas, where decreasing pH links to primary production decline in variable salinity and coastal habitats. Climate change has caused decreasing wind speeds in the Bay of Biscay and Iberian Coast, directly reducing shelf habitat primary production. Increasing stratification and surface warming decrease mixed layer depth, further reducing primary production in shelf habitats.

These climate pressures manifest differently across habitats. Strong negative primary production trends occurred across 32 assessment units, with increases documented in only 2 areas. Climate change and decreasing pH resulted in ""Not good"" quality status determinations for coastal habitats in the Greater North Sea, variable salinity, coastal and shelf habitats in the Celtic Seas, and shelf and oceanic habitats in the Bay of Biscay and Iberian Coast.

Phytoplankton respond rapidly to climate pressures due to their physiological plasticity, making primary production a sensitive early warning indicator for ecosystem-wide impacts. Changes in primary production can disrupt higher trophic levels and alter marine food web structure and functioning.",,"The OSPAR report identifies several critical gaps related to climate change assessment and monitoring. Primary production assessment periods are severely limited, with only two years of data available for COMP4 areas, restricting the ability to adequately study assessment periods and increase result reliability. Longer data availability is explicitly required to address this limitation and improve comparison with other pelagic and food web indicators.

Climate change linkages to primary production changes are evident across multiple regions but remain poorly understood. Despite relationships with environmental variables being unclear, climate change has been linked with indicators in coastal habitats of the Greater North Sea, variable salinity and coastal habitats of the Celtic Seas, and shelf/oceanic habitats of the Bay of Biscay and Iberian Coast. However, the methodology cannot generalize pressure-ecosystem links across all sites in the pilot assessment.

Data gaps significantly constrain assessment capabilities. White areas in assessments indicate insufficient data, while satellite data frequently lacks winter coverage (November-February) in the Northern North Sea due to cloud cover. Additional datasets are particularly needed for the Bay of Biscay and Iberian Coast to improve spatial and temporal confidence.

Methodological limitations include the inability to distinguish between natural versus human-induced pressures or identify pressure origins. The assessment requires introduction of lag variables to test delayed effects of environmental pressures on primary production. Current methodology assumes consistent annual cycles, but primary production shows large year-to-year variability requiring more sophisticated evaluation tools.

Links between climate pressures and primary production changes need refinement to identify pressure origins, and reinforcement of in-situ measurements across different habitats within OSPAR regions is crucial for maintaining adequate monitoring capabilities.",,"Based on the technical assessment of phytoplankton primary production as an indicator for marine food webs, several climate change-related recommendations and research needs emerge.

**Key Recommendations:**
Climate change measures should be integrated into national policies, strategies and planning. Marine and coastal ecosystems require sustainable management and protection to avoid significant adverse impacts, with emphasis on strengthening their resilience and taking restoration actions to achieve healthy and productive oceans.

**Climate Change Impacts Identified:**
The assessment reveals significant climate-related pressures affecting primary production across OSPAR regions. Surface warming emerged as the most important pressure linked to declining primary production in coastal habitats at broad scale. In shelf habitats, reduced primary production is linked to decreasing mixed layer depth, probably related to increasing stratification and surface warming. Climate change has been evidenced as causing decreasing wind speeds, which correlates with primary production decreases in the Bay of Biscay and Iberian Coast shelf habitat.

**Research Gaps Requiring Investigation:**
Multiple critical research areas need addressing: methodology improvement to define more precisely the natural cycle of primary production; consideration of multiple regime shifts instead of single long-term trends; comparison with relevant pelagic habitat and food web indicators; reinforcement of in-situ measurements for validation of satellite algorithms; inclusion of more field-based time-series data; development of spatial and temporal confidence indices; and refinement of pressure-indicator relationships to distinguish between natural versus human-induced pressures.

**Specific Technical Needs:**
Future work must investigate annual cycles for non-stationary datasets, test for delayed effects of environmental pressures, quantify phytoplankton's contribution to pH variability, and examine satellite data at finer spatial scales, particularly for turbid and eutrophic water bodies in variable salinity and coastal habitats.",,"Ocean acidification, reflected through decreasing pH, has been identified as a significant environmental pressure affecting marine ecosystems across multiple OSPAR regions. Decreasing pH accounted for 13% of the most important variables linked to declining primary production across the assessment area.

In the Celtic Seas (OSPAR Region III), decreasing pH was specifically linked to declining primary production in variable salinity and coastal habitats, though the downward trend in primary production was statistically insignificant. Similarly, decreasing pH has been connected to indicators within coastal habitats of the Greater North Sea (OSPAR Region II), variable salinity, coastal and shelf habitats of the Celtic Seas, and shelf and oceanic habitats of the Bay of Biscay and Iberian Coast (OSPAR Region IV).

The relationship between pH and primary production requires careful evaluation because phytoplankton directly influence pH through their uptake of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) for growth and reproduction. This creates a complex feedback loop where declining pH may affect primary production while phytoplankton activity simultaneously influences pH levels. Further analysis is necessary to quantify phytoplankton's contribution to pH variability and to better understand these interactions.

The quality status of marine habitats where decreasing pH has been linked to ecosystem indicators has been assessed as ""Not good,"" indicating that ocean acidification is contributing to deteriorating marine environmental conditions across these regions. The impacts of decreasing pH are occurring alongside other climate change pressures, making it difficult to isolate the specific effects of ocean acidification from broader environmental changes.",,"Ocean acidification impacts marine ecosystems primarily through effects on primary production, which forms the foundation of marine food webs. Decreasing pH has been linked to the decline of primary production in variable salinity and coastal habitats across multiple OSPAR regions, including the Celtic Seas, Greater North Sea, and Bay of Biscay and Iberian Coast. However, the downward trend of primary production was statistically insignificant in the Celtic Seas.

The relationship between pH and primary production requires cautious evaluation because phytoplankton directly impact pH through their ingestion of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) to fuel growth and reproduction, creating a complex feedback loop. Further analysis is necessary to quantify phytoplankton's contribution to pH variability.

Decreasing pH was identified as one of the most important variables linked to decreased primary production, accounting for 13% of the factors affecting primary production changes. Climate change and decreasing pH have been linked with indicators across coastal habitats in the Greater North Sea, variable salinity, coastal and shelf habitats in the Celtic Seas, and shelf and oceanic habitats in the Bay of Biscay and Iberian Coast. Consequently, the quality status within these habitats is classified as ""Not good.""

Ocean acidification affects ecosystems indirectly by reducing primary production, which represents the first input of organic matter in marine food webs and fuels the microbial loop. Since phytoplankton primary production is fundamental to marine ecosystems and represents the first available flow of energy through the ecosystem, acidification-induced declines in primary production can cascade through entire food webs.",,13,1,20
All indicator assessments,Pilot assessment of status and trends of persistent chemicals in marine mammals,OK,p00903_pilot_persistent_chem_marine_mammals,"Based on the provided context, climate change is mentioned only briefly and indirectly in this OSPAR report focused on persistent chemicals in marine mammals. 

The report acknowledges that declining pollutant levels in marine mammals may not necessarily indicate environmental improvement, as temporal trends could result from changes in diet due to environmental change rather than actual decreases in persistent organic pollutant concentrations in the environment. This uncertainty complicates the interpretation of contamination trends in marine species.

The context provided does not contain substantive information about climate change impacts, temperature changes, ocean acidification effects, or other climate-related findings. The report focuses primarily on polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) contamination in marine mammals across OSPAR regions, with detailed analysis of contamination levels, temporal trends, and assessment methodologies for various species including harbour porpoises, seals, and cetaceans.

The limited climate change reference suggests that environmental changes may influence marine mammal feeding patterns and thus contamination pathways, but the report does not elaborate on specific climate change mechanisms, impacts, or data. The document's primary scientific findings relate to persistent chemical pollution rather than climate change effects in the North-East Atlantic Ocean.

To answer questions about OSPAR's climate change findings comprehensively, context from climate-focused OSPAR reports would be necessary, as this particular document addresses chemical contamination monitoring rather than climate change assessment.",,"Based on the provided context, there is extremely limited direct discussion of climate change-related threats or pressures. The document focuses primarily on persistent organic pollutants (POPs), particularly PCBs, in marine mammals rather than climate-related pressures.

The only direct climate-related threat mentioned is ocean acidification, which appears alongside climate change as environmental challenges that the North-East Atlantic Ocean needs to be resilient to.

However, one important indirect climate connection emerges regarding pollutant trends. When examining declining levels of certain pollutants in fish and marine mammal species, it remains unclear whether temporal trends result from decreased POP concentrations in the environment or from dietary changes due to environmental change. This uncertainty about environmental change impacts on marine mammal diet represents a potential climate-related pressure affecting pollution assessment accuracy.

Mean PCB concentrations were found to be 6-to-9-fold greater in Icelandic killer whales with mixed diets, suggesting that environmental changes affecting prey availability and dietary patterns could significantly influence contaminant exposure levels in marine mammals.

The document acknowledges that marine mammals serve as sentinels for ocean and human health due to their long lifespans that permit expression of chronic diseases, abnormalities in growth and development, and cancer. However, the assessment does not elaborate on how climate change might exacerbate these health impacts or create additional pressures.

The context provided is insufficient to comprehensively answer questions about climate change threats and pressures, as this OSPAR report appears to be specifically focused on chemical contaminants rather than climate-related stressors in the marine environment.",,"The provided context does not address how climate change impacts species, habitats and ecosystems. The context consists entirely of content from an OSPAR report focused on persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in marine mammals of the North-East Atlantic Ocean.

The document examines chemical contamination rather than climate impacts. It details how persistent organic pollutants bioaccumulate through marine food webs, with marine mammals serving as apex predators that accumulate extremely high concentrations of these chemicals in their blubber. The report documents PCB concentrations declining in some fish and marine mammal species since the 1970s-1990s, though it notes uncertainty about whether these trends reflect reduced environmental concentrations or dietary changes due to environmental change.

The only reference to climate change appears in an organizational vision statement about creating a marine environment ""resilient to climate change and ocean acidification,"" but this provides no scientific information about climate impacts on marine life.

The context thoroughly covers chemical pollution effects on marine mammals, including immunosuppression, endocrine disruption, reproductive impairment, reduced lifespan, chronic diseases, growth abnormalities, and cancer formation. However, it contains no data, findings, or analysis regarding temperature changes, sea level rise, ocean acidification effects, habitat shifts, ecosystem disruptions, or other climate change impacts on marine species and their environments.

To answer the question about climate change impacts on species, habitats and ecosystems, different source material focusing specifically on climate science and ecological responses would be required.",,"The provided context does not specifically address gaps in relation to climate change. The document focuses on persistent chemicals (PCBs) in marine mammals and identifies several methodological and data gaps, but these are not climate change-related.

The document mentions climate change only in passing, noting that declining pollutant levels in marine mammals may not necessarily reflect reduced environmental contamination but could result from dietary changes due to environmental change. Additionally, there is a single reference to climate resilience in OSPAR's vision statement.

The substantive gaps identified in the document relate to PCB monitoring and assessment: major temporal gaps exist regarding PCB concentrations at congener level, with most studies until 2008 focusing only on seven specific PCB types; major geographical data gaps exist for Arctic waters and OSPAR Region V; limited funding has restricted data acquisition across species, areas, years, and both sexes; there is underrepresentation of remote areas and rarer marine mammal species; effective cause-effect relationships between PCB levels and marine mammal health are largely missing; and harmonization is needed across countries for reference materials and analytical methods.

The document recommends broader ecosystem-level approaches and expanded research beyond PCBs to include other persistent chemicals, but these recommendations are not framed in terms of climate change impacts or adaptation. Raw data unavailability prevented calculation of marine mammals at risk proportions, and most results are discussed qualitatively rather than through statistical analysis due to limited data availability across species and regions.",,"Based on the provided context, there are no specific recommendations related to climate change, nor issues requiring further investigation regarding climate change impacts. The document focuses exclusively on persistent chemical pollutants (particularly PCBs) in marine mammals within the OSPAR Maritime Area.

The recommendations center on improving chemical contamination monitoring and research. OSPAR contracting parties recommend structuring and harmonizing pollutants data acquisition across species, age and sex groups, and congener lists through international databases like ICES. They advocate for harmonization of reference materials and blubber extraction methods across contracting parties, requiring national and international funding to homogenize efforts region-wide.

Future research should expand beyond PCB congener analysis to include other legacy pollutants (PBDEs, OCPs, HBCDs, MeHg) and emerging chemicals (PCNs, SCCPs), while assessing potential interactions and synergistic effects. Scientific efforts should target excluded PCB congeners to develop continuous 20+ year datasets and evaluate how different congeners represent total contaminant loads.

Key research gaps identified include the need for structural harmonized protocols for PCBs data acquisition, validation of reproductive toxicity thresholds, and funding for toxicity studies incorporating multiple health indicators including infectious disease rates and general health assessments.

The only climate change reference appears in an organizational vision statement about ocean resilience to climate change and acidification, but no substantive climate-related recommendations or research priorities are presented in the technical content. The document's scope is limited to persistent chemical pollutant assessment methodologies and monitoring improvements.",,"The provided context contains extremely limited information about ocean acidification. The only substantive reference appears in two identical statements indicating that the North-East Atlantic Ocean should be ""resilient to climate change and ocean acidification."" However, this appears to be an organizational vision statement rather than a scientific finding.

The entire document focuses exclusively on persistent organic pollutants (POPs), particularly polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), in marine mammals. The report examines bioaccumulation of these chemicals in marine mammals as sentinel species, discusses PCB trends showing decreases between the 1990s and early 2000s in sediments and marine biota, and notes that toxic effects including immunosuppression, endocrine disruption, and reproductive impairment are still associated with moderate to high levels of POPs in marine mammals despite declining trends.

The context provides no scientific data, findings, measurements, trends, impacts, or analysis specifically related to ocean acidification in the OSPAR Maritime Area. There are no pH measurements, carbonate chemistry data, biological impacts from acidification, or acidification-related research findings presented. The document's focus remains entirely on chemical contaminants rather than ocean chemistry changes associated with increased atmospheric CO2 absorption.

Therefore, while ocean acidification is acknowledged as a concern requiring resilience in the North-East Atlantic, the provided context contains no substantive scientific information to answer questions about what the reports say regarding ocean acidification's status, trends, or impacts.",,"The provided context does not contain any information about ocean acidification impacts on species, habitats and ecosystems. The context consists entirely of a technical report focused on persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in marine mammals within the North-East Atlantic Ocean.

The context documents persistent chemical contamination patterns across different marine mammal functional groups, with offshore small toothed cetaceans showing higher PCB concentrations than coastal small toothed cetaceans, deep-diving cetaceans, pinnipeds, and baleen whales. The report identifies that despite declining pollutant levels in some fish and marine mammal species, toxic effects including immunosuppression, endocrine disruption, reproductive impairment and reduced lifespan remain associated with moderate to high POP levels in marine mammal tissues.

While ocean acidification is mentioned twice in passing as part of broader environmental concerns, no data, analysis, or findings regarding its specific impacts on marine species, habitats, or ecosystems are provided. The assessment focuses exclusively on chemical contamination monitoring using marine mammals as sentinel species for pollution trends, particularly examining harbour porpoises as model species due to their extensive spatial and temporal data availability across OSPAR regions.

To answer the question about ocean acidification impacts, different source materials containing relevant oceanographic and ecological research would be required.",,3,1,4
